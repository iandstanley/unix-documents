     This document describes in extremely terse form the features
of the −−mmee macro package for version seven NROFF/TROFF.  Some fa‐
miliarity is assumed  with  those  programs.   Specifically,  the
reader  should  understand breaks, fonts, pointsizes, the use and
definition of number registers and strings, how to define macros,
and  scaling factors for ens, points, vv’s (vertical line spaces),
etc.

     For a more casual  introduction  to  text  processing  using
NROFF, refer to the document _W_r_i_t_i_n_g _P_a_p_e_r_s _w_i_t_h _N_R_O_F_F _u_s_i_n_g _−_m_e_.

     There are a number of macro parameters that may be adjusted.
Fonts may be set to a font number only.  Font 8 means  bold  font
in  TROFF;  in NROFF font 8 is underlined unless the −−rrbb33 flag is
specified to use “true bold” font (most versions of NROFF do  not
interpret  bold font nicely).  Font 0 is no font change; the font
of the surrounding text is used instead.  Notice that fonts 0 and
8  are “pseudo‐fonts”; that is, they are simulated by the macros.
This means that although it is legal to set a  font  register  to
zero  or eight, it is not legal to use the escape character form,
such as:

    \f8


     All distances are in basic units, so  it  is  nearly  always
necessary  to  use a scaling factor.  For example, the request to
set the paragraph indent to eight one‐en spaces is:

    .nr pi 8n

and not

    .nr pi 8

which would set the paragraph indent to  eight  basic  units,  or
about  0.02 inch.  Default parameter values are given in brackets
in the remainder of this document.

     Registers and strings of the form $$_x may be used in  expres‐
sions  but  should not be changed.  Macros of the form $$_x perform
some function (as described) and may be redefined to change  this
function.  This may be a sensitive operation; look at the body of
the original macro before changing it.

     All names in −me follow a rigid naming convention.  The user
may  define  number registers, strings, and macros, provided that
s/he uses single character upper case names or  double  character
names  consisting  of letters and digits, with at least one upper
case letter.  In no case should special  characters  be  used  in
user‐defined names.

     On  daisy wheel type printers in twelve pitch, the −−rrxx11 flag
can be stated to make lines default to one eighth inch (the  nor‐
mal spacing for a newline in twelve‐pitch).  This is normally too
small for easy readability, so the default is to space one  sixth
inch.

     The  −−rrvv22 flag will indicates that this _i_s being output on a
C/A/T phototypesetter; this changes the page offset  and  inserts
cut marks.

     This documentation was NROFF’ed

on  October  28,  2021  and  applies  to  version 2.29 of the −me
macros.

11..  PPaarraaggrraapphhiinngg

     These macros are used to  begin  paragraphs.   The  standard
paragraph  macro  is  ..pppp; the others are all variants to be used
for special purposes.

     The first call to one of the paragraphing macros defined  in
this  section or the ..sshh macro (defined in the next session) _i_n_i_‐
_t_i_a_l_i_z_e_s the macro processor.  After  initialization  it  is  not
possible  to use any of the following requests: ..sscc, ..lloo, ..tthh, or
..aacc.  Also, the effects of changing parameters which will have  a
global  effect on the format of the page (notably page length and
header and footer margins) are not well  defined  and  should  be
avoided.

..llpp            Begin left‐justified paragraph.  Centering and un‐
               derlining are turned off if they were on, the font
               is  set to \\nn((ppff [1] the type size is set to \\nn((pppp
               [10p], and a \\nn((ppss space is  inserted  before  the
               paragraph [0.35v in TROFF, 1v or 0.5v in NROFF de‐
               pending on device resolution].  The indent is  re‐
               set  to  \\nn(($$ii [0] plus \\nn((ppoo [0] unless the para‐
               graph is inside a display.  (see ..bbaa).   At  least
               the  first two lines of the paragraph are kept to‐
               gether on a page.

..pppp            Like ..llpp, except that it puts \\nn((ppii [5n] units  of
               indent.  This is the standard paragraph macro.

..iipp_ _T_ _I        Indented  paragraph with hanging tag.  The body of
               the following paragraph is indented _I  spaces  (or
               \\nn((iiii [5n] spaces if _I is not specified) more than
               a non‐indented paragraph (such as  with  ..pppp)  is.
               The  title  _T  is exdented (opposite of indented).
               The result is a paragraph with an even  left  edge
               and _T printed in the margin.  Any spaces in _T must
               be unpaddable.  If _T will not  fit  in  the  space
               provided, ..iipp will start a new line.

..nnpp            A  variant  of .ip which numbers paragraphs.  Num‐
               bering is reset after a ..llpp,  ..pppp,  or  ..sshh.   The
               current paragraph number is in \\nn(($$pp.

..bbuu            Like  ..nnpp  except  that paragraphs are marked with
               bullets (•).  Leading space is eliminated to  cre‐
               ate compact lists.

22..  SSeeccttiioonn HHeeaaddiinnggss

     Numbered  sections  are  similar to paragraphs except that a
section number is automatically generated for each one.  The sec‐
tion  numbers are of the form 11..22..33.  The _d_e_p_t_h of the section is
the count of numbers (separated by decimal points) in the section
number.

     Unnumbered section headings are similar, except that no num‐
ber is attached to the heading.

..sshh_ _+_N_ _T_ _a_ _b_ _c _dBe_egi_fn numbered section of depth _N.  If _N is  miss‐
               ing  the  current  depth (maintained in the number
               register \\nn(($$00) is used.  The values of the  indi‐
               vidual  parts of the section number are maintained
               in \\nn(($$11 through \\nn(($$66.  There  is  a  \\nn((ssss  [1v]
               space  before the section.  _T is printed as a sec‐
               tion title in font \\nn((ssff [8] and size \\nn((sspp [10p].
               The  “name”  of  the  section  may be accessed via
               \\**(($$nn.  If \\nn((ssii is non‐zero, the base  indent  is
               set  to  \\nn((ssii  times  the  section depth, and the










UUSSDD::2200‐‐44                                     −−mmee RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall


               section title is exdented.  (See ..bbaa.)   Also,  an
               additional  indent  of  \\nn((ssoo  [0] is added to the
               section title (but not to the  body  of  the  sec‐
               tion).   The  font  is  then  set to the paragraph
               font, so that more information may  occur  on  the
               line  with  the section number and title.  ..sshh in‐
               sures that there is enough room to print the  sec‐
               tion head plus the beginning of a paragraph (about
               3 lines total).  If _a through _f are specified, the
               section  number  is set to that number rather than
               incremented automatically.  If any of _a through  _f
               are  a hyphen that number is not reset.  If _T is a
               single underscore (“_”) then the section depth and
               numbering is reset, but the base indent is not re‐
               set and nothing is printed out.  This is useful to
               automatically   coordinate  section  numbers  with
               chapter numbers.

..ssxx_ _+_N         Go to section depth _N [−−11], but do not  print  the
               number and title, and do not increment the section
               number at level _N.  This has the effect of  start‐
               ing a new paragraph at level _N.

..uuhh_ _T          Unnumbered   section  heading.   The  title  _T  is
               printed with the same  rules  for  spacing,  font,
               etc., as for ..sshh.

..$$pp_ _T_ _B_ _N      Print  section  heading.   May be redefined to get
               fancier headings.  _T is the title  passed  on  the
               ..sshh  or ..uuhh line; _B is the section number for this
               section, and _N  is  the  depth  of  this  section.
               These  parameters  are not always present; in par‐
               ticular, ..sshh passes all three, ..uuhh passes only the
               first, and ..ssxx passes three, but the first two are
               null strings.  Care should be taken if this  macro
               is redefined; it is quite complex and subtle.

..$$00_ _T_ _B_ _N      This  macro  is  called  automatically after every
               call to ..$$pp.  It is normally undefined, but may be
               used to automatically put every section title into
               the table of contents or for  some  similar  func‐
               tion.   _T is the section title for the section ti‐
               tle which was just printed, _B is the section  num‐
               ber, and _N is the section depth.

..$$11_ −_ ..$$66      Traps  called just before printing that depth sec‐
               tion.  May be defined to (for example) give  vari‐
               able  spacing  before  sections.  These macros are
               called from ..$$pp, so if you redefine that macro you
               may lose this feature.

     Headers  and  footers are put at the top and bottom of every
page automatically.  They are set in  font  \\nn((ttff  [3]  and  size
\\nn((ttpp  [10p].  Each of the definitions apply as of the _n_e_x_t page.
Three‐part titles must be quoted if there are two blanks adjacent
anywhere in the title or more than eight blanks total.

     The  spacing  of headers and footers are controlled by three
number registers.  \\nn((hhmm [4v] is the distance from the top of the
page  to  the  top of the header, \\nn((ffmm [3v] is the distance from
the bottom of the page to the bottom of the footer, \\nn((ttmm [7v] is
the distance from the top of the page to the top of the text, and
\\nn((bbmm [6v] is the distance from the bottom of  the  page  to  the
bottom  of the text (nominal).  The macros ..mm11, ..mm22, ..mm33, and ..mm44
are also supplied for compatibility with ROFF documents.

..hhee_ _´_l_´_m_´_r_´    Define three‐part header, to be printed on the top
               of every page.

               even‐numbered page.

..oohh_ _´_l_´_m_´_r_´    Define  header,  to be printed at the top of every
               odd‐numbered page.

..eeff_ _´_l_´_m_´_r_´    Define footer, to be printed at the bottom of  ev‐
               ery even‐numbered page.

..ooff_ _´_l_´_m_´_r_´    Define  footer, to be printed at the bottom of ev‐
               ery odd‐numbered page.

..hhxx            Suppress headers and footers on the next page.

..mm11_ _+_N         Set the space between the top of the page and  the
               header [4v].

..mm22_ _+_N         Set  the  space  between  the header and the first
               line of text [2v].

..mm33_ _+_N         Set the space between the bottom of the  text  and
               the footer [2v].

               the page [4v].

..eepp            End this page, but do not  begin  the  next  page.
               Useful  for  forcing out footnotes, but other than
               that hardly every used.  Must be followed by a ..bbpp
               or the end of input.

..$$hh            Called  at every page to print the header.  May be
               redefined  to  provide  fancy  (e.g.,  multi‐line)
               headers,  but  doing  so loses the function of the
               ..hhee, ..ffoo, ..eehh, ..oohh, ..eeff, and ..ooff requests, as well
               as the chapter‐style title feature of ..++cc.

..$$ff            Print footer; same comments apply as in ..$$hh.

..$$HH            A  normally undefined macro which is called at the
               top of each page (after putting  out  the  header,
               initial  saved  floating  keeps,  etc.);  in other
               words, this macro  is  called  immediately  before
               printing  text on a page.  It can be used for col‐
               umn headings and the like.

     All displays except centered blocks  and  block  quotes  are
preceded  and  followed  by an extra \\nn((bbss [same as \\nn((ppss] space.
Quote spacing is stored in a separate register;  centered  blocks
have  no default initial or trailing space.  The vertical spacing
of all displays except quotes and centered blocks  is  stored  in
register \\nn(($$RR instead of \\nn(($$rr.

               in  \\nn(($$ii and set with ..bbaa) is not zero); and if CC
               the list is centered on a line‐by‐line basis.  The

               changes  to  “underline  font” (usually italics in

               is safe in nofill mode only.

               and pasted in later.  To get a partial‐page paste‐
               in display, say ..ssvv _N, where _N is  the  amount  of

..ttpp            Begin title page.  Spacing at the top of the  page
               can occur, and headers and footers are suppressed.
               Also, the page number is not incremented for  this
               page.

..tthh            Set  thesis  mode.  This defines the modes accept‐
               able for a doctoral dissertation at Berkeley.   It
               double  spaces,  defines the header to be a single
               page number, and changes the  margins  to  be  1.5
               inch on the left and one inch on the top.  ..++++ and
               ..++cc should be used with it.  This  macro  must  be
               stated  before initialization, that is, before the
               first call of a paragraphing macro or ..sshh.

..++++_ _m_ _H        This request defines  the  section  of  the  paper
               which  we  are  entering.  The section type is de‐
               fined by _m.  CC means  that  we  are  entering  the
               chapter  portion of the paper, AA means that we are
               entering the appendix  portion  of  the  paper,  PP
               means  that  the  material following should be the
               preliminary portion (abstract, table of  contents,
               etc.)   portion of the paper, AABB means that we are
               entering the abstract (numbered independently from
               1 in Arabic numerals), and BB means that we are en‐
               tering the bibliographic portion at the end of the
               paper.   Also, the variants RRCC and RRAA are allowed,
               which specify renumbering of pages from one at the
               beginning  of  each  chapter  or appendix, respec‐
               tively.  The _H parameter defines the  new  header.
               If  there  are any spaces in it, the entire header
               must be quoted.  If you want the  header  to  have
               the chapter number in it, Use the string \\\\\\\\nn((cchh.
               For example, to number appendixes AA..11  etc.,  type
               ..++++ RRAA ´´´´´´\\\\\\\\nn((cchh..%%´´.  Each section (chapter, ap‐
               pendix, etc.)  should be preceded by the  ..++cc  re‐
               quest.   It  should be mentioned that it is easier
               when using TROFF to put the front material at  the
               end  of  the  paper, so that the table of contents
               can be collected and put out;  this  material  can
               then  be  physically moved to the beginning of the
               paper.

..++cc_ _T          Begin chapter with title _T.  The chapter number is
               maintained in \\nn((cchh.  This register is incremented
               every time ..++cc is called with  a  parameter.   The

               title  and chapter number are printed by ..$$cc.  The
               header is moved to the footer on the first page of
               each chapter.  If _T is omitted, ..$$cc is not called;
               this is useful for doing your own “title page”  at
               the  beginning  of  papers  without  a  title page
               proper.  ..$$cc calls ..$$CC as a hook so  that  chapter
               titles  can  be  inserted into a table of contents
               automatically.  The footnote numbering is reset to
               one.

..$$cc_ _T          Print  chapter  number  (from  \\nn((cchh) and _T.  This
               macro can be redefined to your liking.  It is  de‐
               fined by default to be acceptable for a PhD thesis
               at Berkeley.  This macro calls $$CC,  which  can  be
               defined to make index entries, or whatever.

..$$CC_ _K_ _N_ _T      This macro is called by ..$$cc.  It is normally unde‐
               fined, but can be used to automatically insert in‐
               dex  entries, or whatever.  _K is a keyword, either
               “Chapter” or  “Appendix”  (depending  on  the  ..++++
               mode);  _N is the chapter or appendix number, and _T
               is the chapter or appendix title.

..aacc_ _A_ _N        This macro (short for ..aaccmm) sets up the NROFF  en‐
               vironment  for  camera‐ready papers as used by the
               ACM.  This format is 25% larger, and has no  head‐
               ers or footers.  The author’s name _A is printed at
               the bottom of the page (but  off  the  part  which
               will  be  printed  in the conference proceedings),
               together with the current page number and the  to‐
               tal  number  of pages _N.  Additionally, this macro
               loads the file //uussrr//lliibb//mmee//aaccmm..mmee, which may later
               be augmented with other macros useful for printing
               papers for ACM conferences.  It  should  be  noted
               that this macro will not work correctly in version
               7 TROFF, since it sets the page length wider  than
               the  physical  width  of the C/A/T phototypesetter
               roll.

     There  are  a  number  of special characters and diacritical
marks (such as accents)  available  through  −me.   To  reference
these characters, you must call the macro ..sscc to define the char‐
acters before using them.

..sscc            Define special characters and  diacritical  marks,
               as  described  in  the  remainder of this section.

     I  would like to thank Bob Epstein, Bill Joy, and Larry Rowe
for having the courage to use the −me macros to produce non‐triv‐
ial  papers  during  the  development  stages; Ricki Blau, Pamela
Humphrey, and Jim Joyce for their  help  with  the  documentation
phase; peter kessler for numerous complaints, most accompanied by
fixes; and the plethora of people who have contributed ideas  and
have given support for the project.

SSuummmmaarryy

     This  alphabetical  list summarizes all macros, strings, and
number registers available in the  −me  macros.   Selected  _t_r_o_f_f
commands,  registers,  and  functions are included as well; those
listed can generally be used with impunity.

     The columns are the name of the command, macro, register, or
string; the type of the object, and the description.  Types are MM
for macro or builtin command (invoked with ..  or ´´ in  the  first
input  column),  SS for a string (invoked with \\** or \\**((), RR for a
number register (invoked with \\nn or  \\nn((),  and  FF  for  a  _t_r_o_f_f
builtin  function  (invoked  by  preceding it with a single back‐
slash).

     Lines marked with § are _t_r_o_f_f internal codes.  Lines  marked
with  † or ‡ may be defined by the user to get special functions;
‡ indicates that these are defined by default and  changing  them
may  have  unexpected side effects.  Lines marked with ° are spe‐
cific to _d_i_t_r_o_f_f (device‐independent _t_r_o_f_f).
