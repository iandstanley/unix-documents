Groff was written around 1989. Neatroff's first commit was 2012. 

Neatroff's first commit was 2012. Neatroff tries to fix what is
sees as Groff's shortcomings. After the beginning of groff's
development Plan 9 came out which had an implementation of troff
with unicode support (which groff was missing until fairly recently).
There was also the implementation of TeX and later LaTeX which had
a number of improvements in handling math.

Neateqn improves groff's 'eqn' is almost everyway in its typesetting
(even with the same source).

Neatroff (vs groff) handles fonts substantially easier. Installing
a font in groff is not trivial. Neatroff has a built in utility
'neatmkfn' with the appropriate command flags.

After using 'mkfn' to create the fmt description we can use:

	.fp 12 F2 fontname

To replace the normal roman font:

	.fp -R fontname

Neatroff comes with comprehensive documentation.

With neatroff you can use fontawesome to get symbols if you like.

This feature is unique amongst troff implementations.
