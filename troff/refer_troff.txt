                       (Troff preprocessor)


Uses the format (there are many other fields):

	%K baker88
	%A Mark Baker
	%T Incorporation: A Theory of Grammatical Function Changing
	%I Chicago University Press
	%D 1988

You can convert it from a Bibtex format. In the example above we
have converted it from a bibtex database (as we have a %K reference
which is not needed in REFER).

Note the bibtex required book referene has been assigned to %K
keywords.

Refer is better than bibtex as although it can match a keyword like
bibtex, it can also simply match words and infer the entry. If refer
finds a close enough match it will return the bibliography entry.

A normal groff run might be:

	$ groff -ms example.ms -T pdf > example.pdf

Lets add some citations to example.ms

	$ vi example.ms

	...

	.NH
	Using 'refer'
	.PP
	Lets cite some stuff!
	.{
	hamlet's mill
	.]

	$ refer -p ./my.bib example.ms


This outputs to STDOUT. Piping through tail(1) allows you to check
the bibliographic reference you have just added to the bottom of
the file.

A more typical use:

	$ refer -p ./my.bib |  \
		groff -ms -T pdf example.ms > example.pdf

If we open example.pdf we can see groff has added a footnote to
stuff, and the bibliographic reference has been added to the footnote
at the bottom if the page, all properly formatted with the title
in italics.

So we do not have to write stuff out, nor do we have to remember
the keyword like you have to do in LaTeX.



                        CUSTOMISING OUTPUT


Refer has a few different options:

-p specify bibliographic database 
-e accumulate references
-P moves punctuation
-S changes the label from a numbered footnote 
   to (author name, year)


	$ refer -S -p my.bib $file | \
		groff -ms -T pdf > $file.pdf

	Let's cite some stuff! (Santilana, 1969)


This is a label so the footnote at the bottom of the page reads
authorname year (in small text) followed by the reference.

But this is a little strange. Note the ! after stuff is before te reference: Most style guides want the reference inside the sentance so -P does that


	$ refer -PS -e -p my.bib $file | \
		groff -ms -T pdf > $file.pdf

	Let's cite some stuff (Santilana, 1969)!

For a rolling bibliography rather than footnotes give the '-e'
option. This collects  the refences to a references section at the
end of the document:


	References

	Samilana, 1969 
		....................

There are other comands that can finetune things.

In your document you can add a refer instructions.


	.R1
	no-label-in-reference
	accumulate
	.R2

This block overrides command line options. You can have multiple
.R1 ... .R2 sections as needed in the document.

Most things are done automatically.

If we add the following to example.ms

	.[
	chomsky
	.]

The reference will now be:

	Let's cite some stuff (Santilana, 1969; Chomsky, 1953)!


If there are more than one match for a reference refer will print
to STDERR a warning.

To ensure that I get the correct reference I should specify more
information to narrow down the search. For example:

	.[ 
	chomsky three factors
	.]

Which would match 'Chomsky, 2005'.


Maybe you want to accumulate your references, not at the end of the
document, but per chapter:

First we should turn on accumulate by default:

	.R1
	no-label-in-references
	accumulate
	.R2


	$ refer -PS -e example.ms .....

would accumulate the references to the end of the document.

If we now add another chapter:

	.NH
	New Chapter
	.PP
	Here's a paragraph
	.[
	bakker 1991
	.]

If we now add the following after the end of the first chapter. 

	.[ 
	$LIST$
	.]

We will see all of the references that accumulated upto that point
will be printed out after the end of the first chapter (where you
placed the $LIST$ command).

References after that will be accumulated to either the next $LIST$
instruction -OR- the end of the document.




                 Groff/Refer vs LaTeX Comparison


	$ time (pdflatex testfile && biber testfile  && \
	  pdflatex testfile)
	...
	...
	real	0m4.233s
	user	0m3.901s
	sys	0m0.215s


	$ time (refer -SPe -p $REFBIB testfile.ms | \
		groff -ms -T pdf > testfile.pdf)
	...
	...
	real	0m0.145s
	user	0m0.164s
	sys	0m0.018s


And this is only a tiny file.

A live previewer of LaTeX is a very intensive program. Whereas the
groff suite is almost negligible.
