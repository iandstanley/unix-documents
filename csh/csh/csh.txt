                          [4mABSTRACT[0m

          [4mCsh[24m is a new command language interpreter for
     UNIX® systems.  It incorporates good  features  of
     other  shells  and  a [4mhistory[24m mechanism similar to
     the [4mredo[24m of INTERLISP.  While  incorporating  many
     features  of other shells which make writing shell
     programs (shell scripts) easier, most of the  fea‐
     tures  unique to [4mcsh[24m are designed more for the in‐
     teractive UNIX user.

          UNIX users who have read a general  introduc‐
     tion  to the system will find a valuable basic ex‐
     planation of the shell here.  Simple terminal  in‐
     teraction  with [4mcsh[24m is possible after reading just
     the first section of this  document.   The  second
     section  describes  the shell’s capabilities which
     you can explore after you have begun to become ac‐
     quainted with the shell.  Later sections introduce
     features which are useful, but not  necessary  for
     all users of the shell.

          Additional  information  includes an appendix
     listing special characters  of  the  shell  and  a
     glossary  of terms and commands introduced in this
     manual.


[1mIntroduction[0m

     A [4mshell[24m is a command language interpreter.  [4mCsh[24m is  the
name  of  one  particular  command interpreter on UNIX.  The
primary purpose of [4mcsh[24m is to translate command  lines  typed
at  a  terminal  into  system actions, such as invocation of
other programs.  [4mCsh[24m is a user program  just  like  any  you
might  write.   Hopefully, [4mcsh[24m will be a very useful program
for you in interacting with the UNIX system.

     In addition to this document, you will want to refer to
a   copy  of  the  UNIX  User  Reference  Manual.   The  [4mcsh[0m

documentation in section 1 of the manual provides a full de‐
scription of all features of the shell and is the definitive
reference for questions about the shell.

     Many words in  this  document  are  shown  in  [4mitalics.[0m
These  are  important  words;  names  of commands, and words
which have special meaning in discussing the shell and UNIX.
Many  of  the  words are defined in a glossary at the end of
this document.  If you don’t know what is meant by  a  word,
you should look for it in the glossary.

[1mAcknowledgements[0m

     Numerous people have provided good input about previous
versions of [4mcsh[24m and aided in its debugging and in the debug‐
ging of its documentation.  I would especially like to thank
Michael Ubell who made the crucial observation that  history
commands could be done well over the word structure of input
text, and implemented a prototype history  mechanism  in  an
older version of the shell.  Eric Allman has also provided a
large number of useful comments on  the  shell,  helping  to
unify  those  concepts which are present and to identify and
eliminate useless  and  marginally  useful  features.   Mike
O’Brien  suggested  the  pathname  hashing  mechanism  which
speeds command execution.  Jim Kulp added  the  job  control
and directory stack primitives and added their documentation
to this introduction.

[1m1.  Terminal usage of the shell[0m

[1m1.1.  The basic notion of commands[0m

     A [4mshell[24m in UNIX acts mostly as a medium  through  which
other  [4mprograms[24m  are invoked.  While it has a set of [4mbuiltin[0m
functions which it performs directly,  most  commands  cause
execution  of  programs  that  are, in fact, external to the
shell.  The shell is thus distinguished from the command in‐
terpreters of other systems both by the fact that it is just
a user program, and by the fact that it is used  almost  ex‐
clusively as a mechanism for invoking other programs.

     [4mCommands[24m  in  the  UNIX  system  consist  of  a list of
strings or [4mwords[24m interpreted as a [4mcommand[24m [4mname[24m  followed  by
[4marguments.[24m  Thus the command

     mail bill

consists  of  two words.  The first word [4mmail[24m names the com‐
mand to be executed, in this case  the  mail  program  which
sends  messages  to other users.  The shell uses the name of
the command in attempting to execute it for  you.   It  will
look  in  a  number  of [4mdirectories[24m for a file with the name
[4mmail[24m which is expected to contain the mail program.

     The rest of the words of the command are given as [4margu‐[0m
[4mments[24m  to  the  command itself when it is executed.  In this
case we specified also the argument  [4mbill[24m  which  is  inter‐
preted  by the [4mmail[24m program to be the name of a user to whom
mail is to be sent.  In normal terminal usage we  might  use
the [4mmail[24m command as follows.

     % mail bill
     I have a question about the csh documentation.
     My document seems to be missing page 5.
     Does a page five exist?
          Bill
     EOT
     %


     Here  we typed a message to send to [4mbill[24m and ended this
message with a ^D which sent an end‐of‐file to the mail pro‐
gram.   (Here  and  throughout  this  document, the notation
‘‘^[4mx[24m’’ is to be read ‘‘control‐[4mx[24m’’ and represents the strik‐
ing  of  the [4mx[24m key while the control key is held down.)  The
mail program then echoed the characters ‘EOT’ and  transmit‐
ted  our  message.   The characters ‘% ’ were printed before
and after the mail command by the shell to indicate that in‐
put was needed.

     After typing the ‘% ’ prompt the shell was reading com‐
mand input from our terminal.  We typed a  complete  command









USD:4‐4                       An Introduction to the C shell


‘mail  bill’.  The shell then executed the [4mmail[24m program with
argument [4mbill[24m and went dormant waiting for it  to  complete.
The  mail program then read input from our terminal until we
signalled an end‐of‐file via typing a  ^D  after  which  the
shell  noticed  that mail had completed and signaled us that
it was ready to read from the terminal again by printing an‐
other ‘% ’ prompt.

     This  is  the essential pattern of all interaction with
UNIX through the shell.  A complete command is typed at  the
terminal,  the shell executes the command and when this exe‐
cution completes, it prompts for a new command.  If you  run
the  editor  for  an hour, the shell will patiently wait for
you to finish editing and obediently prompt you again  when‐
ever you finish editing.

     An  example  of a useful command you can execute now is
the [4mtset[24m command, which sets  the  default  [4merase[24m  and  [4mkill[0m
characters on your terminal − the erase character erases the
last character you typed and the kill character  erases  the
entire  line you have entered so far.  By default, the erase
character is the delete key (equivalent to  ‘^?’)   and  the
kill  character  is  ‘^U’.   Some  people prefer to make the
erase character the backspace key (equivalent to ‘^H’).  You
can make this be true by typing

     tset −e

which  tells  the program [4mtset[24m to set the erase character to
tset’s default setting for this character (a backspace).

[1m1.2.  Flag arguments[0m

     A useful notion in UNIX is that  of  a  [4mflag[24m  argument.
While  many arguments to commands specify file names or user
names, some arguments rather specify an optional  capability
of  the  command  which  you wish to invoke.  By convention,
such arguments begin with the character ‘−’ (hyphen).   Thus
the command

     ls

will  produce a list of the files in the current [4mworking[24m [4mdi‐[0m
[4mrectory[24m.  The option [4m−s[24m is the size option, and

     ls −s

causes [4mls[24m to also give, for each file the size of  the  file
in  blocks  of  512 characters.  The manual section for each
command in the UNIX reference manual gives the available op‐
tions  for  each command.  The [4mls[24m command has a large number
of useful and interesting options.  Most other commands have
either no options or only one or two options.  It is hard to
remember  options  of  commands  which  are  not  used  very









An Introduction to the C shell                       USD:4‐5


frequently,  so  most UNIX utilities perform only one or two
functions rather than having a large number of hard  to  re‐
member options.

[1m1.3.  Output to files[0m

     Commands  that  normally  read input or write output on
the terminal can also be executed  with  this  input  and/or
output done to a file.

     Thus suppose we wish to save the current date in a file
called ‘now’.  The command

     date

will print the current date on our terminal.   This  is  be‐
cause  our  terminal  is the default [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m for the
date command and the date command prints  the  date  on  its
standard  output.   The  shell lets us [4mredirect[24m the [4mstandard[0m
[4moutput[24m of a command through a notation using the [4mmetacharac‐[0m
[4mter[24m  ‘>’  and  the  name  of  the file where output is to be
placed.  Thus the command

     date > now

runs the [4mdate[24m command such that its standard output  is  the
file  ‘now’  rather  than  the  terminal.  Thus this command
places the current date and time into the file ‘now’.  It is
important to know that the [4mdate[24m command was unaware that its
output was going to a file rather than to the terminal.  The
shell  performed  this  [4mredirection[24m before the command began
executing.

     One other thing to note here is  that  the  file  ‘now’
need  not have existed before the [4mdate[24m command was executed;
the shell would have created the file if it did  not  exist.
And  if  the  file  did exist?  If it had existed previously
these previous contents would have been discarded!  A  shell
option [4mnoclobber[24m exists to prevent this from happening acci‐
dentally; it is discussed in section 2.2.

     The system normally keeps files which you  create  with
‘>’  and  all other files.  Thus the default is for files to
be permanent.  If you wish to create a file  which  will  be
removed  automatically,  you  can  begin its name with a ‘#’
character, this ‘scratch’ character denotes  the  fact  that
the file will be a scratch file.*  The  system  will  remove
───────────
*Note  that  if your erase character is a ‘#’, you
will have to precede the ‘#’ with a ‘\’.  The fact
that  the ‘#’ character is the old (pre‐CRT) stan‐
dard erase character means that it seldom  appears
in  a  file name, and allows this convention to be
used for scratch files.  If you are using  a  CRT,









USD:4‐6                       An Introduction to the C shell


such  files  after a couple of days, or sooner if file space
becomes very tight.   Thus,  in  running  the  [4mdate[24m  command
above,  we  don’t really want to save the output forever, so
we would more likely do

     date > #now


[1m1.4.  Metacharacters in the shell[0m

     The shell has a  large  number  of  special  characters
(like  ‘>’)  which  indicate special functions.  We say that
these notations have [4msyntactic[24m and [4msemantic[24m meaning  to  the
shell.   In  general, most characters which are neither let‐
ters nor digits have special meaning to the shell.  We shall
shortly  learn  a  means of [4mquotation[24m which allows us to use
[4mmetacharacters[24m without the shell treating them in  any  spe‐
cial way.

     Metacharacters normally have effect only when the shell
is reading our input.  We need not worry about placing shell
metacharacters  in a letter we are sending via [4mmail,[24m or when
we are typing in text or data to some other  program.   Note
that  the  shell  is only reading input when it has prompted
with ‘% ’ (although we can type our  input  even  before  it
prompts).

[1m1.5.  Input from files; pipelines[0m

     We learned above how to [4mredirect[24m the [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m of
a command to a file.  It is also possible  to  redirect  the
[4mstandard[24m  [4minput[24m of a command from a file.  This is not often
necessary since most commands will read from  a  file  whose
name is given as an argument.  We can give the command

     sort < data

to  run the [4msort[24m command with standard input, where the com‐
mand normally reads its input, from  the  file  ‘data’.   We
would more likely say

     sort data

letting  the [4msort[24m command open the file ‘data’ for input it‐
self since this is less to type.

     We should note that if we just typed

     sort

then the sort program would sort  lines  from  its  [4mstandard[0m
───────────
your  erase character should be a ^H, as we demon‐
strated in section 1.1 how this could be set up.









An Introduction to the C shell                       USD:4‐7


[4minput.[24m   Since  we  did  not [4mredirect[24m the standard input, it
would sort lines as we typed them on the terminal  until  we
typed a ^D to indicate an end‐of‐file.

     A  most useful capability is the ability to combine the
standard output of one command with the  standard  input  of
another,  i.e.  to run the commands in a sequence known as a
[4mpipeline.[24m  For instance the command

     ls −s

normally produces a list of the files in our directory  with
the size of each in blocks of 512 characters.  If we are in‐
terested in learning which of our files is  largest  we  may
wish  to have this sorted by size rather than by name, which
is the default way in which [4mls[24m sorts.  We could look at  the
many  options of [4mls[24m to see if there was an option to do this
but would eventually discover that there is not.  Instead we
can use a couple of simple options of the [4msort[24m command, com‐
bining it with [4mls[24m to get what we want.

     The [4m−n[24m option of sort specifies a numeric  sort  rather
than an alphabetic sort.  Thus

     ls −s | sort −n

specifies that the output of the [4mls[24m command run with the op‐
tion [4m−s[24m is to be [4mpiped[24m to the command [4msort[24m run with the  nu‐
meric  sort option.  This would give us a sorted list of our
files by size, but with the smallest first.  We  could  then
use  the [4m−r[24m reverse sort option and the [4mhead[24m command in com‐
bination with the previous command doing

     ls −s | sort −n −r | head −5

Here we have taken a list of  our  files  sorted  alphabeti‐
cally,  each  with  the size in blocks.  We have run this to
the standard input of the [4msort[24m command asking it to sort nu‐
merically in reverse order (largest first).  This output has
then been run into the command [4mhead[24m which gives us the first
few  lines.  In this case we have asked [4mhead[24m for the first 5
lines.  Thus this command gives us the names  and  sizes  of
our 5 largest files.

     The notation introduced above is called the [4mpipe[24m mecha‐
nism.  Commands separated by ‘|’  characters  are  connected
together by the shell and the standard output of each is run
into the standard input of the next.  The  leftmost  command
in a pipeline will normally take its standard input from the
terminal and the rightmost will place its standard output on
the  terminal.   Other  examples  of pipelines will be given
later when we discuss the history mechanism;  one  important
use of pipes which is illustrated there is in the routing of
information to the line printer.

[1m1.6.  Filenames[0m

     Many commands to be executed will  need  the  names  of
files  as  arguments.  UNIX [4mpathnames[24m consist of a number of
[4mcomponents[24m separated by ‘/’.  Each component except the last
names  a  directory  in which the next component resides, in
effect specifying the [4mpath[24m of directories to follow to reach
the file.  Thus the pathname

     /etc/motd

specifies a file in the directory ‘etc’ which is a subdirec‐
tory of the [4mroot[24m directory ‘/’.  Within this  directory  the
file  named is ‘motd’ which stands for ‘message of the day’.
A [4mpathname[24m that begins with a slash is said to be  an  [4mabso‐[0m
[4mlute[24m pathname since it is specified from the absolute top of
the entire directory hierarchy of  the  system  (the  [4mroot[24m).
[4mPathnames[24m  which  do  not  begin with ‘/’ are interpreted as
starting in the current [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m, which is, by  de‐
fault, your [4mhome[24m directory and can be changed dynamically by
the [4mcd[24m change directory command.  Such pathnames are said to
be [4mrelative[24m to the working directory since they are found by
starting in the working directory and  descending  to  lower
levels  of  directories  for each [4mcomponent[24m of the pathname.
If the pathname contains no slashes at all then the file  is
contained  in  the working directory itself and the pathname
is merely the name of the file in this directory.   Absolute
pathnames have no relation to the working directory.

     Most  filenames  consist  of  a  number of alphanumeric
characters and ‘.’s (periods).  In fact, all printing  char‐
acters  except  ‘/’  (slash) may appear in filenames.  It is
inconvenient to have most non‐alphabetic characters in file‐
names  because  many  of  these  have special meaning to the
shell.  The character ‘.’ (period) is not a  shell‐metachar‐
acter  and is often used to separate the [4mextension[24m of a file
name from the base of the name.  Thus

     prog.c prog.o prog.errs prog.output

are four related files.  They share a [4mbase[24m portion of a name
(a  base  portion  being  that part of the name that is left
when a trailing ‘.’ and following characters which  are  not
‘.’  are  stripped  off).   The  file  ‘prog.c’ might be the
source for a C program, the file ‘prog.o’ the  corresponding
object  file, the file ‘prog.errs’ the errors resulting from
a compilation of the program and the file ‘prog.output’  the
output of a run of the program.

     If  we  wished to refer to all four of these files in a
command, we could use the notation

     prog.*










An Introduction to the C shell                       USD:4‐9


This expression is expanded by the shell, before the command
to which it is an argument is executed, into a list of names
which begin with ‘prog.’.  The character  ‘*’  here  matches
any sequence (including the empty sequence) of characters in
a file name.   The  names  which  match  are  alphabetically
sorted and placed in the [4margument[24m [4mlist[24m of the command.  Thus
the command

     echo prog.*

will echo the names

     prog.c prog.errs prog.o prog.output

Note that the names are in sorted order here, and a  differ‐
ent  order  than we listed them above.  The [4mecho[24m command re‐
ceives four words as arguments, even though  we  only  typed
one  word as an argument directly.  The four words were gen‐
erated by [4mfilename[24m [4mexpansion[24m of the one input word.

     Other notations for [4mfilename[24m [4mexpansion[24m are also  avail‐
able.   The  character ‘?’ matches any single character in a
filename.  Thus

     echo ? ?? ???

will echo a line of filenames; first those with one  charac‐
ter  names, then those with two character names, and finally
those with three character names.  The names of each  length
will be independently sorted.

     Another  mechanism consists of a sequence of characters
between ‘[’ and ‘]’.  This metasequence matches  any  single
character from the enclosed set.  Thus

     prog.[co]

will match

     prog.c prog.o

in  the  example  above.   We  can also place two characters
around a ‘−’ in this notation to denote a range.  Thus

     chap.[1−5]

might match files

     chap.1 chap.2 chap.3 chap.4 chap.5

if they existed.  This is shorthand for

     chap.[12345]










USD:4‐10                      An Introduction to the C shell


and otherwise equivalent.

     An important point to note is that if a list  of  argu‐
ment words to a command (an [4margument[24m [4mlist)[24m contains filename
expansion syntax, and  if  this  filename  expansion  syntax
fails  to match any existing file names, then the shell con‐
siders this to be an error and prints a diagnostic

     No match.

and does not execute the command.

     Another very important point is  that  files  with  the
character  ‘.’ at the beginning are treated specially.  Nei‐
ther ‘*’ or ‘?’ or the ‘[’  ‘]’  mechanism  will  match  it.
This  prevents  accidental matching of the filenames ‘.’ and
‘..’  in the working directory which have special meaning to
the  system, as well as other files such as [4m.cshrc[24m which are
not normally visible.  We will discuss the special  role  of
the file [4m.cshrc[24m later.

     Another  filename  expansion  mechanism gives access to
the pathname of the [4mhome[24m directory of other users.  This no‐
tation consists of the character ‘~’ (tilde) followed by an‐
other user’s login name.   For  instance  the  word  ‘~bill’
would  map to the pathname ‘/usr/bill’ if the home directory
for ‘bill’ was ‘/usr/bill’.  Since, on large systems,  users
may  have  login  directories  scattered over many different
disk volumes with different prefix directory names, this no‐
tation  provides  a convenient way of accessing the files of
other users.

     A special case of  this  notation  consists  of  a  ‘~’
alone,  e.g.  ‘~/mbox’.   This  notation  is expanded by the
shell into the file ‘mbox’ in your [4mhome[24m directory, i.e. into
‘/usr/bill/mbox’  for  me  on Ernie Co‐vax, the UCB Computer
Science Department VAX machine, where this document was pre‐
pared.   This  can  be  very  useful  if you have used [4mcd[24m to
change to another directory and have found a file  you  wish
to copy using [4mcp.[24m  If I give the command

     cp thatfile ~

the shell will expand this command to

     cp thatfile /usr/bill

since my home directory is /usr/bill.

     There  also exists a mechanism using the characters ‘{’
and ‘}’ for abbreviating a set of words  which  have  common
parts  but cannot be abbreviated by the above mechanisms be‐
cause they are not files, are the names of  files  which  do
not  yet  exist,  are not thus conveniently described.  This









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐11


mechanism will be described much later, in section  4.2,  as
it is used less frequently.

[1m1.7.  Quotation[0m

     We have already seen a number of metacharacters used by
the shell.  These metacharacters pose a problem in  that  we
cannot  use  them directly as parts of words.  Thus the com‐
mand

     echo *

will not echo the character ‘*’.   It  will  either  echo  a
sorted  list  of filenames in the current [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory,[0m
or print the message ‘No match’ if there are no files in the
working directory.

     The  recommended mechanism for placing characters which
are neither numbers, digits, ‘/’, ‘.’ or ‘−’ in an  argument
word  to  a  command  is to enclose it with single quotation
characters ‘´’, i.e.

     echo ´*´

There is one special character ‘!’ which is used by the [4mhis‐[0m
[4mtory[24m  mechanism  of the shell and which cannot be [4mescaped[24m by
placing it within ‘´’ characters.  It and the character  ‘´’
itself can be preceded by a single ‘\’ to prevent their spe‐
cial meaning.  Thus

     echo \´\!

prints

     ´!

These two mechanisms suffice to place any printing character
into  a  word which is an argument to a shell command.  They
can be combined, as in

     echo \´´*´

which prints

     ´*

since the first ‘\’ escaped the first ‘´’ and  the  ‘*’  was
enclosed between ‘´’ characters.

[1m1.8.  Terminating commands[0m

     When you are executing a command and the shell is wait‐
ing for it to complete there are several ways to force it to
stop.  For instance if you type the command









USD:4‐12                      An Introduction to the C shell


     cat /etc/passwd

the  system  will print a copy of a list of all users of the
system on your terminal.  This is  likely  to  continue  for
several  minutes unless you stop it.  You can send an INTER‐
RUPT [4msignal[24m to the [4mcat[24m command by typing ^C on  your  termi‐
nal.*   Since  [4mcat[24m does not take any precautions to avoid or
otherwise handle this signal the INTERRUPT will cause it  to
terminate.   The  shell  notices that [4mcat[24m has terminated and
prompts you again with ‘% ’.  If you  hit  INTERRUPT  again,
the  shell  will just repeat its prompt since it handles IN‐
TERRUPT signals and chooses to continue to execute  commands
rather  than  terminating like [4mcat[24m did, which would have the
effect of logging you out.

     Another way in which many programs  terminate  is  when
they get an end‐of‐file from their standard input.  Thus the
[4mmail[24m program in the first example above was terminated  when
we  typed a ^D which generates an end‐of‐file from the stan‐
dard input.  The shell also terminates when it gets an  end‐
of‐file  printing  ‘logout’; UNIX then logs you off the sys‐
tem.  Since this means that typing too many ^D’s  can  acci‐
dentally  log us off, the shell has a mechanism for prevent‐
ing this.  This [4mignoreeof[24m option will be discussed  in  sec‐
tion 2.2.

     If  a  command has its standard input redirected from a
file, then it will normally terminate when  it  reaches  the
end of this file.  Thus if we execute

     mail bill < prepared.text

the  mail  command  will  terminate without our typing a ^D.
This is because it read to the end‐of‐file of our file ‘pre‐
pared.text’  in which we placed a message for ‘bill’ with an
editor program.  We could also have done

     cat prepared.text | mail bill

since the [4mcat[24m command  would  then  have  written  the  text
through  the pipe to the standard input of the mail command.
When the [4mcat[24m command completed  it  would  have  terminated,
closing  down  the  pipeline and the [4mmail[24m command would have
received an end‐of‐file from it  and  terminated.   Using  a
pipe  here  is more complicated than redirecting input so we
would more likely use the first form.  These commands  could
also have been stopped by sending an INTERRUPT.

     Another  possibility  for stopping a command is to sus‐
pend its execution  temporarily,  with  the  possibility  of
───────────

has the same effect. "stty all" will tell you  the
INTR key value.

continuing  execution later.  This is done by sending a STOP
signal via typing a ^Z.  This  signal  causes  all  commands
running  on the terminal (usually one but more if a pipeline
is executing) to become suspended.  The shell  notices  that
the command(s) have been suspended, types ‘Stopped’ and then
prompts for a new command.  The previously executing command
has  been  suspended,  but  otherwise unaffected by the STOP
signal.  Any other commands can be executed while the origi‐
nal command remains suspended.  The suspended command can be
continued using the [4mfg[24m command with no arguments.  The shell
will  then retype the command to remind you which command is
being continued, and cause the command to resume  execution.
Unless  any input files in use by the suspended command have
been changed in the meantime, the suspension has  no  effect
whatsoever  on  the  execution of the command.  This feature
can be very useful during editing, when you need to look  at
another  file before continuing.  An example of command sus‐
pension follows.

     % mail harold
     Someone just copied a big file into my directory and its name is
     ^Z
     Stopped
     % ls
     funnyfile
     prog.c
     prog.o
     % jobs
     [1]  + Stopped   mail harold
     % fg
     mail harold
     funnyfile. Do you know who did it?
     EOT
     %

In this example someone was sending a message to Harold  and
forgot  the name of the file he wanted to mention.  The mail
command was suspended by typing ^Z.  When the shell  noticed
that  the mail program was suspended, it typed ‘Stopped’ and
prompted for a new command.  Then the [4mls[24m command  was  typed
to  find out the name of the file.  The [4mjobs[24m command was run
to find out which command was suspended.  At this  time  the
[4mfg[24m  command was typed to continue execution of the mail pro‐
gram.  Input to the mail  program  was  then  continued  and
ended  with  a  ^D which indicated the end of the message at
which time the mail program typed  EOT.   The  [4mjobs[24m  command
will  show which commands are suspended.  The ^Z should only
be typed at the beginning of a line since  everything  typed
on  the current line is discarded when a signal is sent from
the keyboard.  This also happens on INTERRUPT, and QUIT sig‐
nals.   More  information on suspending jobs and controlling
them is given in section 2.6.











USD:4‐14                      An Introduction to the C shell


     If you write or run programs which are  not  fully  de‐
bugged  then  it  may be necessary to stop them somewhat un‐
gracefully.  This can be done by sending them a QUIT signal,
sent by typing a ^\.  This will usually provoke the shell to
produce a message like:

     Quit (Core dumped)

indicating that a file ‘core’ has  been  created  containing
information about the running program’s state when it termi‐
nated due to the QUIT signal.  You  can  examine  this  file
yourself,  or  forward  information to the maintainer of the
program telling him/her where the [4mcore[24m [4mfile[24m is.

     If you run background commands (as explained in section
2.6) then these commands will ignore INTERRUPT and QUIT sig‐
nals at the terminal.  To stop them you must  use  the  [4mkill[0m
command.  See section 2.6 for an example.

     If  you want to examine the output of a command without
having it move off the screen as the output of the

     cat /etc/passwd

command will, you can use the command

     more /etc/passwd

The [4mmore[24m program pauses after each  complete  screenful  and
types  ‘−−More−−’  at which point you can hit a space to get
another screenful, a return to get another line,  a  ‘?’  to
get  some  help  on other commands, or a ‘q’ to end the [4mmore[0m
program.  You can also use more as a filter, i.e.

     cat /etc/passwd | more

works just like the more simple more command above.

     For stopping output of commands not involving [4mmore[24m  you
can  use  the  ^S key to stop the typeout.  The typeout will
resume when you hit ^Q or any other key, but ^Q is  normally
used because it only restarts the output and does not become
input to the program which is running.  This works  well  on
low‐speed  terminals, but at 9600 baud it is hard to type ^S
and ^Q fast enough to paginate the output nicely, and a pro‐
gram like [4mmore[24m is usually used.

     An additional possibility is to use the ^O flush output
character; when this character is typed, all output from the
current  command is thrown away (quickly) until the next in‐
put read occurs or until the next shell prompt.  This can be
used to allow a command to complete without having to suffer
through the output on a slow terminal; ^O is  a  toggle,  so
flushing  can  be turned off by typing ^O again while output

is being flushed.

[1m1.9.  What now?[0m

     We have so far seen a number of mechanisms of the shell
and  learned  a lot about the way in which it operates.  The
remaining sections will go yet further into the internals of
the  shell,  but you will surely want to try using the shell
before you go any further.  To try it you can log in to UNIX
and type the following command to the system:

     chsh myname /bin/csh

Here  ‘myname’  should  be replaced by the name you typed to
the system prompt of ‘login:’ to get onto the system.   Thus
I  would use ‘chsh bill /bin/csh’.  [1mYou only have to do this[0m
[1monce; it takes effect at next login.  [22mYou are now  ready  to
try using [4mcsh.[0m

     Before you do the ‘chsh’ command, the shell you are us‐
ing when you log into the system  is  ‘/bin/sh’.   In  fact,
much  of  the  above  discussion is applicable to ‘/bin/sh’.
The next section will introduce many features particular  to
[4mcsh[24m  so you should change your shell to [4mcsh[24m before you begin
reading it.

[1m2.  Details on the shell for terminal users[0m

[1m2.1.  Shell startup and termination[0m

     When you login, the shell is started by the  system  in
your  [4mhome[24m  directory  and begins by reading commands from a
file [4m.cshrc[24m in this directory.  All  shells  which  you  may
start during your terminal session will read from this file.
We will later see what kinds of commands are usefully placed
there.   For  now  we  need not have this file and the shell
does not complain about its absence.

     A [4mlogin[24m [4mshell[24m, executed after you login to the  system,
will,  after  it  reads  commands from [4m.cshrc,[24m read commands
from a file [4m.login[24m also in your home directory.   This  file
contains  commands  which you wish to do each time you login
to the UNIX system.  My [4m.login[24m file looks something like:

     set ignoreeof
     set mail=(/usr/spool/mail/bill)
     echo "${prompt}users" ; users
     alias ts \
          ´set noglob ; eval `tset −s −m dialup:c100rv4pna −m plugboard:?hp2621nl *`´;
     ts; stty intr ^C kill ^U crt
     set time=15 history=10
     msgs −f
     if (−e $mail) then
          echo "${prompt}mail"
          mail
     endif


     This file contains several commands to be  executed  by
UNIX each time I login.  The first is a [4mset[24m command which is
interpreted directly by the shell.  It sets the shell  vari‐
able [4mignoreeof[24m which causes the shell to not log me off if I
hit ^D.  Rather, I use the [4mlogout[24m command to log off of  the
system.   By  setting  the [4mmail[24m variable, I ask the shell to
watch for incoming mail to me.  Every 5  minutes  the  shell
looks  for  this  file and tells me if more mail has arrived
there.  An alternative to this is to put the command

     biff y

in place of this [4mset;[24m this will cause me to be notified  im‐
mediately  when  mail arrives, and to be shown the first few
lines of the new message.

     Next I set the shell variable ‘time’  to  ‘15’  causing
the  shell  to  automatically print out statistics lines for
commands which execute for at least 15 seconds of CPU  time.
The  variable  ‘history’ is set to 10 indicating that I want
the shell to remember the last 10 commands  I  type  in  its
[4mhistory[24m [4mlist[24m, (described later).









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐17


     I  create an [4malias[24m ‘‘ts’’ which executes a [4mtset[24m(1) com‐
mand setting up the modes of the terminal.   The  parameters
to  [4mtset[24m  indicate the kinds of terminal which I usually use
when not on a hardwired port.  I  then  execute  ‘‘ts’’  and
also  use the [4mstty[24m command to change the interrupt character
to ^C and the line kill character to ^U.

     I then run the ‘msgs’ program, which provides  me  with
any  system  messages which I have not seen before; the ‘−f’
option here prevents it from telling me  anything  if  there
are  no  new  messages.  Finally, if my mailbox file exists,
then I run the ‘mail’ program to process my mail.

     When the ‘mail’ and ‘msgs’ programs finish,  the  shell
will finish processing my [4m.login[24m file and begin reading com‐
mands from the terminal, prompting for each with ‘% ’.  When
I  log  off  (by  giving  the [4mlogout[24m command) the shell will
print ‘logout’ and execute commands from the file  ‘.logout’
if  it  exists  in  my home directory.  After that the shell
will terminate and UNIX will log me off the system.  If  the
system  is  not  going down, I will receive a new login mes‐
sage.  In any case, after the ‘logout’ message the shell  is
committed to terminating and will take no further input from
my terminal.

[1m2.2.  Shell variables[0m

     The shell maintains a set of [4mvariables.[24m  We  saw  above
the  variables  [4mhistory[24m  and  [4mtime[24m which had values ‘10’ and
‘15’.  In fact, each shell variable has as value an array of
zero  or more [4mstrings.[24m  Shell variables may be assigned val‐
ues by the set command.  It has several forms, the most use‐
ful of which was given above and is

     set name=value


     Shell  variables  may be used to store values which are
to be used in commands later through a  substitution  mecha‐
nism.   The  shell  variables  most commonly referenced are,
however, those which the shell itself refers to.  By  chang‐
ing  the  values  of these variables one can directly affect
the behavior of the shell.

     One of the most important  variables  is  the  variable
[4mpath.[24m   This variable contains a sequence of directory names
where the shell searches for commands.  The [4mset[24m command with
no  arguments shows the value of all variables currently de‐
fined (we usually say [4mset)[24m in the shell.  The default  value
for path will be shown by [4mset[24m to be













USD:4‐18                      An Introduction to the C shell


     % set
     argv   ()
     cwd    /usr/bill
     home   /usr/bill
     path   (. /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin)
     prompt %
     shell  /bin/csh
     status 0
     term   c100rv4pna
     user   bill
     %

This  output  indicates that the variable path points to the
current  directory  ‘.’  and  then  ‘/usr/ucb’,  ‘/bin’  and
‘/usr/bin’.   Commands  which  you may write might be in ‘.’
(usually one of your directories).   Commands  developed  at
Berkeley,  live  in  ‘/usr/ucb’  while commands developed at
Bell Laboratories live in ‘/bin’ and ‘/usr/bin’.

     A number of locally developed programs  on  the  system
live  in  the  directory  ‘/usr/local’.  If we wish that all
shells which we invoke to have access to these new  programs
we can place the command

     set path=(. /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin /usr/local)

in  our  file  [4m.cshrc[24m in our home directory.  Try doing this
and then logging out and back in and do

     set

again to see that the value assigned to [4mpath[24m has changed.

     One thing you should be aware of is that the shell  ex‐
amines  each  directory  which you insert into your path and
determines which commands are contained there.   Except  for
the current directory ‘.’, which the shell treats specially,
this means that if commands are added to a directory in your
search  path after you have started the shell, they will not
necessarily be found by the shell.  If you  wish  to  use  a
command  which  has  been added in this way, you should give
the command

     rehash

to the shell, which will cause it to recompute its  internal
table  of  command locations, so that it will find the newly
added command.  Since the shell has to look in  the  current
directory  ‘.’ on each command, placing it at the end of the
path specification usually works  equivalently  and  reduces

uted programs provided with Berkeley Unix.

overhead.

     Other  useful  built in variables are the variable [4mhome[0m
which shows your home directory,  [4mcwd[24m  which  contains  your
current  working directory, the variable [4mignoreeof[24m which can
be set in your [4m.login[24m file to tell the  shell  not  to  exit
when  it  receives  an  end‐of‐file  from a terminal (as de‐
scribed above).  The variable ‘ignoreeof’ is one of  several
variables  which the shell does not care about the value of,
only whether they are [4mset[24m or [4munset.[24m  Thus to set this  vari‐
able you simply do

     set ignoreeof

and to unset it do

     unset ignoreeof

These  give  the  variable ‘ignoreeof’ no value, but none is
desired or required.

     Finally, some other built‐in shell variables of use are
the variables [4mnoclobber[24m and [4mmail.[24m  The metasyntax

     > filename

which  redirects the standard output of a command will over‐
write and destroy the previous contents of the  named  file.
In  this  way you may accidentally overwrite a file which is
valuable.  If you would prefer that the shell not  overwrite
files in this way you can

     set noclobber

in your [4m.login[24m file.  Then trying to do

     date > now

would  cause  a  diagnostic  if  ‘now’ existed already.  You
could type

     date >!  now

if you really wanted to overwrite  the  contents  of  ‘now’.
The  ‘>!’ is a special metasyntax indicating that clobbering
the file is ok.†



───────────
†The space between the ‘!’ and the word  ‘now’  is
critical here, as ‘!now’ would be an invocation of
the [4mhistory[24m mechanism, and have a totally  differ‐
ent effect.









USD:4‐20                      An Introduction to the C shell


[1m2.3.  The shell’s history list[0m

     The  shell  can  maintain  a [4mhistory[24m [4mlist[24m into which it
places the words of previous commands.  It  is  possible  to
use  a  notation to reuse commands or words from commands in
forming new commands.  This mechanism can be used to  repeat
previous  commands  or  to  correct minor typing mistakes in
commands.

     The following figure gives a sample  session  involving
typical  usage  of  the  history mechanism of the shell.  In
this example we have a very simple C program which has a bug
(or  two)  in  it in the file ‘bug.c’, which we ‘cat’ out on
our terminal.  We then try to run the C compiler on it,  re‐
ferring to the file again as ‘!$’, meaning the last argument
to the previous command.  Here the ‘!’ is the history mecha‐
nism  invocation  metacharacter,  and the ‘$’ stands for the
last argument, by analogy to ‘$’ in the editor which  stands
for  the  end of the line.  The shell echoed the command, as
it would have been typed without use of the  history  mecha‐
nism,  and  then executed it.  The compilation yielded error
diagnostics so we now run the editor on  the  file  we  were
trying  to  compile,  fix  the  bug,  and run the C compiler
again, this time referring to this command simply  as  ‘!c’,
which repeats the last command which started with the letter
‘c’.  If there were other commands starting  with  ‘c’  done
recently  we  could  have  said  ‘!cc’ or even ‘!cc:p’ which
would have printed the last command starting with ‘cc’ with‐
out executing it.

     After  this recompilation, we ran the resulting ‘a.out’
file, and then noting that there still was a  bug,  ran  the
editor  again.   After  fixing the program we ran the C com‐
piler again, but tacked onto the command an extra  ‘−o  bug’
telling  the  compiler  to place the resultant binary in the
file ‘bug’ rather than ‘a.out’.   In  general,  the  history
mechanisms may be used anywhere in the formation of new com‐
mands and other characters may be placed  before  and  after
the substituted commands.

     We then ran the ‘size’ command to see how large the bi‐
nary program images we have created were, and  then  an  ‘ls
−l’  command with the same argument list, denoting the argu‐
ment list ‘*’.  Finally we ran the program ‘bug’ to see that
its output is indeed correct.

     To  make  a  numbered listing of the program we ran the
‘num’ command on the file ‘bug.c’.  In order to compress out
blank lines in the output of ‘num’ we ran the output through
the filter ‘ssp’, but misspelled it as spp.  To correct this
we  used  a  shell  substitute, placing the old text and new
text between ‘^’ characters.  This is similar to the substi‐
tute  command  in the editor.  Finally, we repeated the same
command with ‘!!’, but sent its output to the line printer.

     There are other mechanisms available for repeating com‐
mands.   The [4mhistory[24m command prints out a number of previous
commands with numbers  by  which  they  can  be  referenced.
There  is  a way to refer to a previous command by searching
for a string which appeared in it, and there are other, less
useful,  ways  to  select arguments to include in a new com‐
mand.  A complete description of  all  these  mechanisms  is
given  in  the C shell manual pages in the UNIX Programmer’s
Manual.

[1m2.4.  Aliases[0m

     The shell has an [4malias[24m mechanism which can be  used  to
make  transformations on input commands.  This mechanism can
be used to simplify the commands you type, to supply default
arguments to commands, or to perform transformations on com‐
mands and their arguments.  The alias facility is similar to
a macro facility.  Some of the features obtained by aliasing
can be obtained also using shell command  files,  but  these
take  place  in another instance of the shell and cannot di‐
rectly affect the current shells environment or involve com‐
mands such as [4mcd[24m which must be done in the current shell.

     As  an  example, suppose that there is a new version of
the mail program on the system called ‘newmail’ you wish  to
use,  rather  than the standard mail program which is called
‘mail’.  If you place the shell command

     alias mail newmail

in your [4m.cshrc[24m file, the shell will transform an input  line
of the form

     mail bill

into  a  call on ‘newmail’.  More generally, suppose we wish
the command ‘ls’ to always show sizes of files, that  is  to
always do ‘−s’.  We can do

     alias ls ls −s

or even

     alias dir ls −s

creating  a  new command syntax ‘dir’ which does an ‘ls −s’.
If we say

     dir ~bill

then the shell will translate this to

     ls −s /mnt/bill

     Thus the [4malias[24m mechanism can be used to  provide  short
names for commands, to provide default arguments, and to de‐
fine new short commands in terms of other commands.   It  is
also  possible to define aliases which contain multiple com‐
mands or pipelines, showing where the arguments to the orig‐
inal  command  are to be substituted using the facilities of
the history mechanism.  Thus the definition

     alias cd ´cd \!* ; ls ´

would do an [4mls[24m command after each change directory  [4mcd[24m  com‐
mand.   We enclosed the entire alias definition in ‘´’ char‐
acters to prevent most substitutions from occurring and  the
character ‘;’ from being recognized as a metacharacter.  The
‘!’ here is escaped with a ‘\’ to prevent it from being  in‐
terpreted  when  the  alias  command is typed in.  The ‘\!*’
here substitutes the entire argument list to the  pre‐alias‐
ing [4mcd[24m command, without giving an error if there were no ar‐
guments.  The ‘;’ separating commands is used here to  indi‐
cate that one command is to be done and then the next.  Sim‐
ilarly the definition

     alias whois ´grep \!^ /etc/passwd´

defines a command which looks up its first argument  in  the
password file.

     [1mWarning: [22mThe shell currently reads the [4m.cshrc[24m file each
time it starts up.  If you place a large number of  commands
there,  shells  will  tend to start slowly.  A mechanism for
saving the shell environment after reading the  [4m.cshrc[24m  file
and  quickly  restoring it is under development, but for now
you should try to limit the number of aliases you have to  a
reasonable  number...  10 or 15 is reasonable, 50 or 60 will
cause a noticeable delay in starting up shells, and make the
system  seem  sluggish when you execute commands from within
the editor and other programs.

[1m2.5.  More redirection; >> and >&[0m

     There are a few more notations useful to  the  terminal
user which have not been introduced yet.

     In  addition to the standard output, commands also have
a [4mdiagnostic[24m [4moutput[24m which is normally directed to the termi‐
nal even when the standard output is redirected to a file or
a pipe.  It is occasionally desirable to direct the diagnos‐
tic  output along with the standard output.  For instance if
you want to redirect the output of a  long  running  command
into  a file and wish to have a record of any error diagnos‐
tic it produces you can do

     command >& file










USD:4‐24                      An Introduction to the C shell


The ‘>&’ here tells the shell to route both  the  diagnostic
output  and  the standard output into ‘file’.  Similarly you
can give the command

     command |& lpr

to route both standard and  diagnostic  output  through  the
pipe to the line printer daemon [4mlpr.‡[0m

     Finally, it is possible to use the form

     command >> file

to place output at the end of an existing file.†

[1m2.6.  Jobs; Background, Foreground, or Suspended[0m

     When one or more commands are typed together as a pipe‐
line or as a sequence of commands separated by semicolons, a
single  [4mjob[24m is created by the shell consisting of these com‐
mands together as a unit.  Single commands without pipes  or
semicolons  create  the  simplest jobs.  Usually, every line
typed to the shell creates a job.  Some  lines  that  create
jobs (one per line) are

     sort < data
     ls −s | sort −n | head −5
     mail harold


     If  the  metacharacter  ‘&’  is typed at the end of the
commands, then the job is started as a [4mbackground[24m job.  This
means  that  the  shell does not wait for it to complete but
immediately prompts and is ready for another  command.   The
job  runs  [4min[24m  [4mthe[24m  [4mbackground[24m  at the same time that normal
jobs, called [4mforeground[24m jobs, continue to be read  and  exe‐
cuted by the shell one at a time.  Thus

     du > usage &

would run the [4mdu[24m program, which reports on the disk usage of
your working directory (as well  as  any  directories  below
it),  put  the  output  into  the  file  ‘usage’  and return
───────────
‡ A command of the form
     command >&! file
exists, and is used when [4mnoclobber[24m is set and [4mfile[0m
already exists.
† If [4mnoclobber[24m is set, then an error  will  result
if  [4mfile[24m  does not exist, otherwise the shell will
create [4mfile[24m if it doesn’t exist.  A form
     command >>! file
makes it not be an error for  file  to  not  exist
when [4mnoclobber[24m is set.

immediately with a prompt for the next command  without  out
waiting for [4mdu[24m to finish.  The [4mdu[24m program would continue ex‐
ecuting in the background until it finished, even though you
can type and execute more commands in the mean time.  When a
background job terminates, a message is typed by  the  shell
just  before  the  next  prompt telling you that the job has
completed.  In the following example  the  [4mdu[24m  job  finishes
sometime  during  the  execution of the [4mmail[24m command and its
completion is reported just before the prompt after the [4mmail[0m
job is finished.

     % du > usage &
     [1] 503
     % mail bill
     How do you know when a background job is finished?
     EOT
     [1] − Done       du > usage
     %

If  the  job  did  not terminate normally the ‘Done’ message
might say something else like ‘Killed’.   If  you  want  the
terminations  of  background jobs to be reported at the time
they occur (possibly interrupting the output of other  fore‐
ground  jobs), you can set the [4mnotify[24m variable.  In the pre‐
vious example this would mean that the ‘Done’ message  might
have come right in the middle of the message to Bill.  Back‐
ground jobs are unaffected by any signals from the  keyboard
like the STOP, INTERRUPT, or QUIT signals mentioned earlier.

     Jobs  are  recorded  in  a table inside the shell until
they terminate.  In this table, the shell remembers the com‐
mand  names,  arguments  and the [4mprocess[24m [4mnumbers[24m of all com‐
mands in the job as well as the working directory where  the
job was started.  Each job in the table is either running [4min[0m
[4mthe[24m [4mforeground[24m with the shell waiting for it  to  terminate,
running  [4min[24m  [4mthe[24m [4mbackground,[24m or [4msuspended.[24m  Only one job can
be running in the foreground at one time, but  several  jobs
can  be  suspended or running in the background at once.  As
each job is started, it is assigned a small identifying num‐
ber  called  the [4mjob[24m [4mnumber[24m which can be used later to refer
to the job in the commands described below.  Job numbers re‐
main the same until the job terminates and then are re‐used.

     When  a job is started in the background using ‘&’, its
number, as well as the  process  numbers  of  all  its  (top
level)  commands, is typed by the shell before prompting you
for another command.  For example,

     % ls −s | sort −n > usage &
     [2] 2034 2035
     %

runs the ‘ls’ program with the ‘−s’ options, pipes this out‐
put  into the ‘sort’ program with the ‘−n’ option which puts









USD:4‐26                      An Introduction to the C shell


its output into the file ‘usage’.  Since the ‘&’ was at  the
end of the line, these two programs were started together as
a background job.  After starting the job, the shell  prints
the  job number in brackets (2 in this case) followed by the
process number of each program started in the job.  Then the
shell  immediates prompts for a new command, leaving the job
running simultaneously.

     As mentioned in section  1.8,  foreground  jobs  become
[4msuspended[24m by typing ^Z which sends a STOP signal to the cur‐
rently running foreground job.  A background job can  become
suspended  by  using the [4mstop[24m command described below.  When
jobs are suspended they merely stop any further progress un‐
til  started  again,  either  in the foreground or the back‐
ground.  The shell notices when a job  becomes  stopped  and
reports  this  fact, much like it reports the termination of
background jobs.  For foreground jobs this looks like

     % du > usage
     ^Z
     Stopped
     %

‘Stopped’ message is typed by the shell when it notices that
the [4mdu[24m program stopped.  For background jobs, using the [4mstop[0m
command, it is

     % sort usage &
     [1] 2345
     % stop %1
     [1] + Stopped (signal)sort usage
     %

Suspending foreground jobs can be very useful when you  need
to temporarily change what you are doing (execute other com‐
mands) and then return to the suspended  job.   Also,  fore‐
ground  jobs  can  be  suspended and then continued as back‐
ground jobs using the [4mbg[24m command, allowing you  to  continue
other  work  and stop waiting for the foreground job to fin‐
ish.  Thus

     % du > usage
     ^Z
     Stopped
     % bg
     [1] du > usage &
     %

starts ‘du’ in the foreground, stops it before it  finishes,
then continues it in the background allowing more foreground
commands to be executed.  This is especially helpful when  a
foreground  job  ends up taking longer than you expected and
you wish you had started it in the background in the  begin‐
ning.









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐27


     All  [4mjob[24m  [4mcontrol[24m  commands  can  take an argument that
identifies a particular job.  All job name  arguments  begin
with  the  character ‘%’, since some of the job control com‐
mands also accept process numbers (printed by  the  [4mps[24m  com‐
mand.)   The  default  job  (when  no  argument is given) is
called the [4mcurrent[24m job and is identified by  a  ‘+’  in  the
output  of  the [4mjobs[24m command, which shows you which jobs you
have.  When only one job is stopped or running in the  back‐
ground (the usual case) it is always the current job thus no
argument is needed.  If a job is stopped  while  running  in
the  foreground  it becomes the [4mcurrent[24m job and the existing
current job becomes the [4mprevious[24m job − identified by  a  ‘−’
in the output of [4mjobs.[24m  When the current job terminates, the
previous job becomes the current job.  When given, the argu‐
ment  is  either  ‘%−’  (indicating the previous job); ‘%#’,
where # is the job number; ‘%pref’ where pref is some unique
prefix of the command name and arguments of one of the jobs;
or ‘%?’ followed by some string found in  only  one  of  the
jobs.

     The  [4mjobs[24m  command  types the table of jobs, giving the
job number, commands and status (‘Stopped’ or ‘Running’)  of
each  background or suspended job.  With the ‘−l’ option the
process numbers are also typed.

     % du > usage &
     [1] 3398
     % ls −s | sort −n > myfile &
     [2] 3405
     % mail bill
     ^Z
     Stopped
     % jobs
     [1] − Running    du > usage
     [2]    Running   ls −s | sort −n > myfile
     [3] + Stopped    mail bill
     % fg %ls
     ls −s | sort −n > myfile
     % more myfile


     The [4mfg[24m command runs a suspended or  background  job  in
the  foreground.   It  is  used to restart a previously sus‐
pended job or change a background job to run  in  the  fore‐
ground  (allowing  signals  or input from the terminal).  In
the above example we used [4mfg[24m to change the ‘ls’ job from the
background  to the foreground since we wanted to wait for it
to finish before looking at its output file.  The [4mbg[24m command
runs  a suspended job in the background.  It is usually used
after stopping the currently running foreground job with the
STOP  signal.  The combination of the STOP signal and the [4mbg[0m
command changes a foreground job into a background job.  The
[4mstop[24m command suspends a background job.










USD:4‐28                      An Introduction to the C shell


     The  [4mkill[24m  command terminates a background or suspended
job immediately.  In addition  to  jobs,  it  may  be  given
process  numbers  as  arguments, as printed by [4mps.[24m  Thus, in
the example above, the running [4mdu[24m command  could  have  been
terminated by the command

     % kill %1
     [1]  Terminated  du > usage
     %


     The [4mnotify[24m command (not the variable mentioned earlier)
indicates that the termination of a specific job  should  be
reported  at the time it finishes instead of waiting for the
next prompt.

     If a job running in the background tries to read  input
from  the terminal it is automatically stopped.  When such a
job is then run in the foreground, input can be given to the
job.  If desired, the job can be run in the background again
until it requests input again.  This is illustrated  in  the
following  sequence where the ‘s’ command in the text editor
might take a long time.

     % ed bigfile
     120000
     1,$s/thisword/thatword/
     ^Z
     Stopped
     % bg
     [1] ed bigfile &
     %
      . . .  some foreground commands
     [1] Stopped (tty input)ed bigfile
     % fg
     ed bigfile
     w
     120000
     q
     %

So after the ‘s’  command  was  issued,  the  ‘ed’  job  was
stopped  with  ^Z  and  then put in the background using [4mbg.[0m
Some time later when the ‘s’ command was finished, [4med[24m  tried
to  read another command and was stopped because jobs in the
background cannot read from the terminal.   The  [4mfg[24m  command
returned  the ‘ed’ job to the foreground where it could once
again accept commands from the terminal.

     The command

     stty tostop

causes all background jobs run on your terminal to stop when









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐29


they  are  about to write output to the terminal.  This pre‐
vents messages from background jobs from interrupting  fore‐
ground  job  output and allows you to run a job in the back‐
ground without losing terminal output.  It also can be  used
for  interactive  programs  that sometimes have long periods
without interaction.  Thus each time it outputs a prompt for
more  input  it will stop before the prompt.  It can then be
run in the foreground using [4mfg,[24m more input can be given and,
if  necessary  stopped and returned to the background.  This
[4mstty[24m command might be a good thing to  put  in  your  [4m.login[0m
file  if  you do not like output from background jobs inter‐
rupting your work.  It also can reduce the  need  for  redi‐
recting  the  output of background jobs if the output is not
very big:

     % stty tostop
     % wc hugefile &
     [1] 10387
     % ed text
     . . . some time later
     q
     [1] Stopped (tty output)wc hugefile
     % fg wc
     wc hugefile
        13371   30123   302577
     % stty −tostop

Thus after some time the  ‘wc’  command,  which  counts  the
lines,  words and characters in a file, had one line of out‐
put.  When it  tried  to  write  this  to  the  terminal  it
stopped.   By  restarting it in the foreground we allowed it
to write on the terminal exactly when we were ready to  look
at its output.  Programs which attempt to change the mode of
the terminal will also block, whether or not [4mtostop[24m is  set,
when they are not in the foreground, as it would be very un‐
pleasant to have a background job change the  state  of  the
terminal.

     Since  the [4mjobs[24m command only prints jobs started in the
currently executing shell, it knows nothing about background
jobs  started in other login sessions or within shell files.
The [4mps[24m can be used in this case to find out about background
jobs not started in the current shell.

[1m2.7.  Working Directories[0m

     As  mentioned  in section 1.6, the shell is always in a
particular [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory.[24m  The ‘change  directory’  com‐
mand  [4mchdir[24m (its short form [4mcd[24m may also be used) changes the
working directory of the shell, that is, changes the  direc‐
tory you are located in.

     It  is  useful to make a directory for each project you
wish to work on and to  place  all  files  related  to  that









USD:4‐30                      An Introduction to the C shell


project  in  that  directory.  The ‘make directory’ command,
[4mmkdir,[24m creates a new directory.  The [4mpwd[24m (‘print working di‐
rectory’) command reports the absolute pathname of the work‐
ing directory of the shell, that is, the directory  you  are
located in.  Thus in the example below:

     % pwd
     /usr/bill
     % mkdir newpaper
     % chdir newpaper
     % pwd
     /usr/bill/newpaper
     %

the  user  has  created and moved to the directory [4mnewpaper.[0m
where, for example, he might place a group of related files.

     No matter where you have moved to in a directory  hier‐
archy,  you can return to your ‘home’ login directory by do‐
ing just

     cd

with no arguments.  The name ‘..’ always means the directory
above the current one in the hierarchy, thus

     cd ..

changes  the  shell’s  working directory to the one directly
above the current one.  The name ‘..’ can  be  used  in  any
pathname, thus,

     cd ../programs

means  change  to  the directory ‘programs’ contained in the
directory above the current one.  If you have several direc‐
tories  for  different projects under, say, your home direc‐
tory, this shorthand notation permits you to  switch  easily
between them.

     The  shell always remembers the pathname of its current
working directory in the variable [4mcwd.[24m  The shell  can  also
be  requested  to  remember  the previous directory when you
change to a new working directory.  If the ‘push  directory’
command  [4mpushd[24m is used in place of the [4mcd[24m command, the shell
saves the name of the current working directory on a  [4mdirec‐[0m
[4mtory[24m [4mstack[24m before changing to the new one.  You can see this
list at any time by typing the ‘directories’ command [4mdirs.[0m

     % pushd newpaper/references
     ~/newpaper/references  ~
     % pushd /usr/lib/tmac
     /usr/lib/tmac  ~/newpaper/references  ~
     % dirs









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐31


     /usr/lib/tmac  ~/newpaper/references  ~
     % popd
     ~/newpaper/references  ~
     % popd
     ~
     %

The list is printed in a horizontal line,  reading  left  to
right,  with  a  tilde (~) as shorthand for your home direc‐
tory—in this  case  ‘/usr/bill’.   The  directory  stack  is
printed  whenever  there is more than one entry on it and it
changes.  It is also printed by a  [4mdirs[24m  command.   [4mDirs[24m  is
usually  faster and more informative than [4mpwd[24m since it shows
the current working directory as well as any other  directo‐
ries remembered in the stack.

     The  [4mpushd[24m command with no argument alternates the cur‐
rent directory with the first directory in  the  list.   The
‘pop directory’ [4mpopd[24m command without an argument returns you
to the directory you were in prior to the current one,  dis‐
carding  the previous current directory from the stack (for‐
getting it).  Typing [4mpopd[24m several times in  a  series  takes
you  backward  through  the  directories  you  had  been  in
(changed to) by [4mpushd[24m command.  There are other  options  to
[4mpushd[24m  and  [4mpopd[24m to manipulate the contents of the directory
stack and to change to directories not at  the  top  of  the
stack; see the [4mcsh[24m manual page for details.

     Since  the  shell  remembers  the  working directory in
which each job was started, it warns you when you  might  be
confused  by  restarting a job in the foreground which has a
different working directory than the current working  direc‐
tory of the shell.  Thus if you start a background job, then
change the shell’s working  directory  and  then  cause  the
background job to run in the foreground, the shell warns you
that the working directory of the  currently  running  fore‐
ground job is different from that of the shell.

     % dirs −l
     /mnt/bill
     % cd myproject
     % dirs
     ~/myproject
     % ed prog.c
     1143
     ^Z
     Stopped
     % cd ..
     % ls
     myproject
     textfile
     % fg
     ed prog.c (wd: ~/myproject)










USD:4‐32                      An Introduction to the C shell


This way the shell warns you when there is an implied change
of working directory, even though no cd command was  issued.
In   the   above   example   the   ‘ed’  job  was  still  in
‘/mnt/bill/project’ even though the  shell  had  changed  to
‘/mnt/bill’.   A  similar warning is given when such a fore‐
ground job terminates or is suspended (using the  STOP  sig‐
nal) since the return to the shell again implies a change of
working directory.

     % fg
     ed prog.c (wd: ~/myproject)
      . . . after some editing
     q
     (wd now: ~)
     %

These messages are sometimes confusing if you  use  programs
that  change  their own working directories, since the shell
only remembers which directory a job is started in, and  as‐
sumes it stays there.  The ‘−l’ option of [4mjobs[24m will type the
working directory of suspended or background jobs when it is
different from the current working directory of the shell.

[1m2.8.  Useful built‐in commands[0m

     We  now  give  a few of the useful built‐in commands of
the shell describing how they are used.

     The [4malias[24m command described above is used to assign new
aliases and to show the existing aliases.  With no arguments
it prints the current aliases.  It may also  be  given  only
one argument such as

     alias ls

to show the current alias for, e.g., ‘ls’.

     The  [4mecho[24m  command  prints  its arguments.  It is often
used in [4mshell[24m [4mscripts[24m or as an interactive  command  to  see
what filename expansions will produce.

     The  [4mhistory[24m command will show the contents of the his‐
tory list.  The numbers given with the history events can be
used  to  reference  previous  events which are difficult to
reference using the contextual mechanisms introduced  above.
There  is also a shell variable called [4mprompt.[24m  By placing a
‘!’ character in its value the shell will  there  substitute
the  number of the current command in the history list.  You
can use this number to refer to this command  in  a  history
substitution.  Thus you could

     set prompt=´\! % ´

Note  that  the  ‘!’  character  had to be [4mescaped[24m here even









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐33


within ‘´’ characters.

     The [4mlimit[24m command is used to restrict use of resources.
With no arguments it prints the current limitations:

     cputime   unlimited
     filesize  unlimited
     datasize  5616 kbytes
     stacksize 512 kbytes
     coredumpsizeunlimited

Limits can be set, e.g.:

     limit coredumpsize 128k

Most  reasonable  units abbreviations will work; see the [4mcsh[0m
manual page for more details.

     The [4mlogout[24m command can be used  to  terminate  a  login
shell which has [4mignoreeof[24m set.

     The  [4mrehash[24m command causes the shell to recompute a ta‐
ble of where commands are located.  This is necessary if you
add  a  command to a directory in the current shell’s search
path and wish the shell to  find  it,  since  otherwise  the
hashing algorithm may tell the shell that the command wasn’t
in that directory when the hash table was computed.

     The [4mrepeat[24m command can be used to repeat a command sev‐
eral  times.   Thus  to make 5 copies of the file [4mone[24m in the
file [4mfive[24m you could do

     repeat 5 cat one >> five


     The [4msetenv[24m command can be used to set variables in  the
environment.  Thus

     setenv TERM adm3a

will  set  the  value  of  the  environment variable TERM to
‘adm3a’.  A user program [4mprintenv[24m exists  which  will  print
out the environment.  It might then show:

     % printenv
     HOME=/usr/bill
     SHELL=/bin/csh
     PATH=:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local
     TERM=adm3a
     USER=bill
     %












USD:4‐34                      An Introduction to the C shell


     The  [4msource[24m  command  can  be used to force the current
shell to read commands from a file.  Thus

     source .cshrc

can be used after editing in a change  to  the  [4m.cshrc[24m  file
which you wish to take effect right away.

     The  [4mtime[24m  command can be used to cause a command to be
timed no matter how much CPU time it takes.  Thus

     % time cp /etc/rc /usr/bill/rc
     0.0u 0.1s 0:01 8% 2+1k 3+2io 1pf+0w
     % time wc /etc/rc /usr/bill/rc
          52    178   1347 /etc/rc
          52    178   1347 /usr/bill/rc
         104    356   2694 total
     0.1u 0.1s 0:00 13% 3+3k 5+3io 7pf+0w
     %

indicates that the [4mcp[24m command used a  negligible  amount  of
user  time  (u)  and  about 1/10th of a system time (s); the
elapsed time was 1 second (0:01), there was an average  mem‐
ory  usage of 2k bytes of program space and 1k bytes of data
space over the cpu time involved  (2+1k);  the  program  did
three  disk  reads and two disk writes (3+2io), and took one
page fault and was not swapped  (1pf+0w).   The  word  count
command  [4mwc[24m  on the other hand used 0.1 seconds of user time
and 0.1 seconds of system time in  less  than  a  second  of
elapsed  time.  The percentage ‘13%’ indicates that over the
period when it was active the command ‘wc’ used  an  average
of 13 percent of the available CPU cycles of the machine.

     The  [4munalias[24m  and  [4munset[24m commands can be used to remove
aliases and variable definitions from  the  shell,  and  [4mun‐[0m
[4msetenv[24m removes variables from the environment.

[1m2.9.  What else?[0m

     This  concludes  the  basic discussion of the shell for
terminal users.  There are more features of the shell to  be
discussed  here, and all features of the shell are discussed
in its manual pages.  One useful feature which is  discussed
later  is  the [4mforeach[24m built‐in command which can be used to
run the same command sequence with a number of different ar‐
guments.

     If you intend to use UNIX a lot you should look through
the rest of this document and the  csh  manual  pages  (sec‐
tion1)  to  become  familiar with the other facilities which
are available to you.

[1m3.  Shell control structures and command scripts[0m

[1m3.1.  Introduction[0m

     It is possible to place commands in files and to  cause
shells to be invoked to read and execute commands from these
files, which are called [4mshell[24m [4mscripts.[24m  We here detail those
features of the shell useful to the writers of such scripts.

[1m3.2.  Make[0m

     It  is  important  to first note what shell scripts are
[4mnot[24m useful for.  There is a program  called  [4mmake[24m  which  is
very useful for maintaining a group of related files or per‐
forming sets of operations on related files.  For instance a
large  program  consisting of one or more files can have its
dependencies described in a [4mmakefile[24m which contains  defini‐
tions  of  the commands used to create these different files
when changes occur.  Definitions of the means  for  printing
listings,  cleaning  up the directory in which the files re‐
side, and installing the resultant programs are easily,  and
most  appropriately placed in this [4mmakefile.[24m  This format is
superior and preferable to maintaining a group of shell pro‐
cedures to maintain these files.

     Similarly  when working on a document a [4mmakefile[24m may be
created which defines how different versions of the document
are  to  be  created and which options of [4mnroff[24m or [4mtroff[24m are
appropriate.

[1m3.3.  Invocation and the argv variable[0m

     A [4mcsh[24m command script may be interpreted by saying

     % csh script ...

where [4mscript[24m is the name of the file containing a  group  of
[4mcsh[24m  commands  and  ‘...’ is replaced by a sequence of argu‐
ments.  The shell places these  arguments  in  the  variable
[4margv[24m  and  then  begins  to  read  commands from the script.
These parameters are then available through the same  mecha‐
nisms which are used to reference any other shell variables.

     If you make the file ‘script’ executable by doing

     chmod 755 script

and  place  a  shell  comment  at the beginning of the shell
script (i.e. begin the file with a  ‘#’  character)  then  a
‘/bin/csh’ will automatically be invoked to execute ‘script’
when you type

     script










USD:4‐36                      An Introduction to the C shell


If the file does not begin with  a  ‘#’  then  the  standard
shell ‘/bin/sh’ will be used to execute it.  This allows you
to convert your older shell scripts to use [4mcsh[24m at your  con‐
venience.

[1m3.4.  Variable substitution[0m

     After  each input line is broken into words and history
substitutions are done on it, the input line is parsed  into
distinct commands.  Before each command is executed a mecha‐
nism know as [4mvariable[24m [4msubstitution[24m is done on  these  words.
Keyed  by  the  character ‘$’ this substitution replaces the
names of variables by their values.  Thus

     echo $argv

when placed in a command  script  would  cause  the  current
value of the variable [4margv[24m to be echoed to the output of the
shell script.  It is an error for [4margv[24m to be unset  at  this
point.

     A number of notations are provided for accessing compo‐
nents and attributes of variables.  The notation

     $?name

expands to ‘1’ if name is [4mset[24m or to ‘0’ if name is not  [4mset.[0m
It  is  the  fundamental mechanism used for checking whether
particular variables have been assigned values.   All  other
forms of reference to undefined variables cause errors.

     The notation

     $#name

expands  to  the  number  of  elements in the variable [4mname.[0m
Thus

     % set argv=(a b c)
     % echo $?argv
     1
     % echo $#argv
     3
     % unset argv
     % echo $?argv
     0
     % echo $argv
     Undefined variable: argv.
     %


     It is also possible to access the components of a vari‐
able which has several values.  Thus










An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐37


     $argv[1]

gives  the  first  component of [4margv[24m or in the example above
‘a’.  Similarly

     $argv[$#argv]

would give ‘c’, and

     $argv[1−2]

would give ‘a b’. Other notations useful  in  shell  scripts
are

     $[4mn[0m

where [4mn[24m is an integer as a shorthand for

     $argv[[4mn[24m]

the [4mnth[24m parameter and

     $*

which is a shorthand for

     $argv

The form

     $$

expands  to  the process number of the current shell.  Since
this process number is unique in the system it can  be  used
in generation of unique temporary file names.  The form

     $<

is  quite  special and is replaced by the next line of input
read from the shell’s standard input (not the script  it  is
reading).  This is useful for writing shell scripts that are
interactive, reading commands from  the  terminal,  or  even
writing  a shell script that acts as a filter, reading lines
from its input file.  Thus the sequence

     echo ’yes or no?\c’
     set a=($<)

would write out the prompt ‘yes or no?’  without  a  newline
and  then  read  the  answer into the variable ‘a’.  In this
case ‘$#a’ would be ‘0’ if either a blank  line  or  end‐of‐
file (^D) was typed.











USD:4‐38                      An Introduction to the C shell


     One minor difference between ‘$[4mn[24m’ and ‘$argv[[4mn[24m]’ should
be noted here.  The form ‘$argv[[4mn[24m]’ will yield an error if [4mn[0m
is  not  in the range ‘1−$#argv’ while ‘$n’ will never yield
an out of range subscript error.  This is for  compatibility
with the way older shells handled parameters.

     Another important point is that it is never an error to
give a subrange of the form ‘n−’; if there are less  than  [4mn[0m
components  of  the given variable then no words are substi‐
tuted.  A range of the form ‘m−n’ likewise returns an  empty
vector  without giving an error when [4mm[24m exceeds the number of
elements of the given variable, provided the subscript [4mn[24m  is
in range.

[1m3.5.  Expressions[0m

     In  order for interesting shell scripts to be construc‐
ted it must be possible to evaluate expressions in the shell
based  on  the values of variables.  In fact, all the arith‐
metic operations of the language  C  are  available  in  the
shell with the same precedence that they have in C.  In par‐
ticular, the operations ‘==’ and ‘!=’  compare  strings  and
the operators ‘&&’ and ‘||’ implement the boolean and/or op‐
erations.  The special operators ‘=~’ and ‘!~’  are  similar
to  ‘==’  and  ‘!=’ except that the string on the right side
can have pattern matching characters (like *, ? or  [])  and
the  test is whether the string on the left matches the pat‐
tern on the right.

     The shell also allows file enquiries of the form

     −? filename

where ‘?’ is replace by a number of single characters.   For
instance the expression primitive

     −e filename

tell  whether  the file ‘filename’ exists.  Other primitives
test for read, write and execute access to the file, whether
it is a directory, or has non‐zero length.

     It  is  possible  to  test whether a command terminates
normally, by a primitive of the form ‘{ command }’ which re‐
turns  true,  i.e.  ‘1’ if the command succeeds exiting nor‐
mally with exit status 0, or ‘0’ if the  command  terminates
abnormally  or  with exit status non‐zero.  If more detailed
information about the execution status of a command  is  re‐
quired,  it can be executed and the variable ‘$status’ exam‐
ined in the next command.  Since ‘$status’ is set  by  every
command, it is very transient.  It can be saved if it is in‐
convenient to use it only in the single immediately  follow‐
ing command.










An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐39


     For  a full list of expression components available see
the manual section for the shell.

[1m3.6.  Sample shell script[0m

     A sample shell script which makes use of the expression
mechanism  of  the  shell  and some of its control structure
follows:

     % cat copyc
     #
     # Copyc copies those C programs in the specified list
     # to the directory ~/backup if they differ from the files
     # already in ~/backup
     #
     set noglob
     foreach i ($argv)

             if ($i !~ *.c) continue  # not a .c file so do nothing

             if (! −r ~/backup/$i:t) then
                     echo $i:t not in backup... not cp\´ed
                     continue
             endif

             cmp −s $i ~/backup/$i:t # to set $status

             if ($status != 0) then
                     echo new backup of $i
                     cp $i ~/backup/$i:t
             endif
     end


     This script makes use of  the  [4mforeach[24m  command,  which
causes the shell to execute the commands between the [4mforeach[0m
and the matching [4mend[24m for each of the  values  given  between
‘(’ and ‘)’ with the named variable, in this case ‘i’ set to
successive values in the list.  Within this loop we may  use
the command [4mbreak[24m to stop executing the loop and [4mcontinue[24m to
prematurely terminate one iteration and begin the next.  Af‐
ter the [4mforeach[24m loop the iteration variable ([4mi[24m in this case)
has the value at the last iteration.

     We set the variable [4mnoglob[24m here to prevent filename ex‐
pansion  of  the  members  of [4margv.[24m  This is a good idea, in
general, if the arguments to a shell  script  are  filenames
which  have  already  been  expanded or if the arguments may
contain filename expansion metacharacters.  It is also  pos‐
sible  to  quote  each  use of a ‘$’ variable expansion, but
this is harder and less reliable.

     The other control construct used here is a statement of
the form









USD:4‐40                      An Introduction to the C shell


     [1mif [22m( expression ) [1mthen[0m
          command
          ...
     [1mendif[0m

The  placement  of  the keywords here is [1mnot [22mflexible due to
the current implementation of the shell.†

     The shell does have another form of the if statement of
the form

     [1mif [22m( expression ) [1mcommand[0m

which can be written

     [1mif [22m( expression ) \
          command

Here we have escaped the newline for the sake of appearance.
The command must not involve ‘|’, ‘&’ or ‘;’ and must not be
another control command.  The second form requires the final
‘\’ to [1mimmediately [22mprecede the end‐of‐line.

     The  more  general [4mif[24m statements above also admit a se‐
quence of [4melse−if[24m pairs followed by a single [4melse[24m and an [4men‐[0m
[4mdif,[24m e.g.:

     [1mif [22m( expression ) [1mthen[0m
          commands
     [1melse if [22m(expression ) [1mthen[0m
          commands
     ...

     [1melse[0m
          commands
     [1mendif[0m


     Another  important  mechanism  used in shell scripts is
the ‘:’ modifier.  We can use the modifier ‘:r’ here to  ex‐
tract a root of a filename or ‘:e’ to extract the [4mextension.[0m
───────────
†The following two formats are not  currently  ac‐
ceptable to the shell:

     [1mif [22m( expression )        # [1mWon’t work![0m
     [1mthen[0m
          command
          ...
     [1mendif[0m

and

     [1mif [22m( expression ) [1mthen [22mcommand [1mendif         [22m# [1mWon’t work[0m









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐41


Thus if the variable [4mi[24m has the value ‘/mnt/foo.bar’ then

     % echo $i $i:r $i:e
     /mnt/foo.bar /mnt/foo bar
     %

shows how the ‘:r’ modifier strips off the  trailing  ‘.bar’
and the the ‘:e’ modifier leaves only the ‘bar’.  Other mod‐
ifiers will take off the last component of a pathname  leav‐
ing  the  head ‘:h’ or all but the last component of a path‐
name leaving the tail ‘:t’.  These modifiers are  fully  de‐
scribed in the [4mcsh[24m manual pages in the User’s Reference Man‐
ual.  It is also possible to use  the  [4mcommand[24m  [4msubstitution[0m
mechanism  described  in  the  next major section to perform
modifications on strings to then reenter the  shell’s  envi‐
ronment.   Since  each  usage of this mechanism involves the
creation of a new process, it is much more expensive to  use
than  the ‘:’ modification mechanism.‡ Finally, we note that
the character ‘#’ lexically introduces a  shell  comment  in
shell  scripts  (but not from the terminal).  All subsequent
characters on the input line after a ‘#’  are  discarded  by
the shell.  This character can be quoted using ‘´’ or ‘\’ to
place it in an argument word.

[1m3.7.  Other control structures[0m

     The shell also has control structures [4mwhile[24m and  [4mswitch[0m
similar to those of C.  These take the forms

     [1mwhile [22m( expression )
          commands
     [1mend[0m

and










───────────
‡  It  is  also important to note that the current
implementation of the shell limits the  number  of
‘:’ modifiers on a ‘$’ substitution to 1.  Thus

     % echo $i $i:h:t
     /a/b/c /a/b:t
     %

does not do what one would expect.









USD:4‐42                      An Introduction to the C shell


     [1mswitch [22m( word )

     [1mcase [22mstr1:
          commands
          [1mbreaksw[0m

      ...

     [1mcase [22mstrn:
          commands
          [1mbreaksw[0m

     [1mdefault:[0m
          commands
          [1mbreaksw[0m

     [1mendsw[0m

For  details  see the manual section for [4mcsh.[24m  C programmers
should note that we use [4mbreaksw[24m to exit from a [4mswitch[24m  while
[4mbreak[24m  exits  a  [4mwhile[24m or [4mforeach[24m loop.  A common mistake to
make in [4mcsh[24m scripts is to use [4mbreak[24m rather than  [4mbreaksw[24m  in
switches.

     Finally, [4mcsh[24m allows a [4mgoto[24m statement, with labels look‐
ing like they do in C, i.e.:

     loop:
          commands
          [1mgoto [22mloop


[1m3.8.  Supplying input to commands[0m

     Commands run from shell scripts receive by default  the
standard  input  of  the  shell which is running the script.
This is different from previous shells running  under  UNIX.
It  allows  shell scripts to fully participate in pipelines,
but mandates extra notation for commands which are  to  take
inline data.

     Thus  we  need a metanotation for supplying inline data
to commands in shell scripts.  As an example, consider  this
script  which  runs the editor to delete leading blanks from
the lines in each argument file:


















An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐43


     % cat deblank
     # deblank −− remove leading blanks
     foreach i ($argv)
     ed − $i << ´EOF´
     1,$s/^[ ]*//
     w
     q
     ´EOF´
     end
     %

The notation ‘<< ´EOF´’ means that the  standard  input  for
the  [4med[24m command is to come from the text in the shell script
file up to the next line consisting of exactly ‘´EOF´’.  The
fact  that  the  ‘EOF’  is  enclosed in ‘´’ characters, i.e.
quoted, causes the shell to not perform  variable  substitu‐
tion  on  the intervening lines.  In general, if any part of
the word following the ‘<<’ which the shell uses  to  termi‐
nate  the  text  to  be  given to the command is quoted then
these substitutions will not be  performed.   In  this  case
since  we used the form ‘1,$’ in our editor script we needed
to insure that this ‘$’ was not  variable  substituted.   We
could  also have insured this by preceding the ‘$’ here with
a ‘\’, i.e.:

     1,\$s/^[ ]*//

but quoting the ‘EOF’ terminator is a more reliable  way  of
achieving the same thing.

[1m3.9.  Catching interrupts[0m

     If  our  shell  script  creates temporary files, we may
wish to catch interruptions of the shell script so  that  we
can clean up these files.  We can then do

     onintr label

where  [4mlabel[24m  is a label in our program.  If an interrupt is
received the shell will do a ‘goto label’ and we can  remove
the  temporary  files  and then do an [4mexit[24m command (which is
built in to the shell) to exit from the shell script.  If we
wish to exit with a non‐zero status we can do

     exit(1)

e.g. to exit with status ‘1’.

[1m3.10.  What else?[0m

     There are other features of the shell useful to writers
of shell procedures.  The [4mverbose[24m and [4mecho[24m options  and  the
related  [4m−v[24m  and [4m−x[24m command line options can be used to help
trace the actions of the shell.  The [4m−n[24m  option  causes  the









USD:4‐44                      An Introduction to the C shell


shell  only to read commands and not to execute them and may
sometimes be of use.

     One other thing to note is that [4mcsh[24m  will  not  execute
shell  scripts  which  do  not begin with the character ‘#’,
that is shell scripts that do  not  begin  with  a  comment.
Similarly,  the  ‘/bin/sh’  on your system may well defer to
‘csh’ to interpret shell scripts which begin with ‘#’.  This
allows shell scripts for both shells to live in harmony.

     There  is  also  another  quotation mechanism using ‘"’
which allows only some of the expansion mechanisms  we  have
so far discussed to occur on the quoted string and serves to
make this string into a single word as ‘´’ does.

[1m4.  Other, less commonly used, shell features[0m

[1m4.1.  Loops at the terminal; variables as vectors[0m

     It is occasionally useful to use  the  [4mforeach[24m  control
structure  at  the terminal to aid in performing a number of
similar commands.  For instance, there  were  at  one  point
three  shells  in  use on the Cory UNIX system at Cory Hall,
‘/bin/sh’, ‘/bin/nsh’, and ‘/bin/csh’.  To count the  number
of  persons  using each shell one could have issued the com‐
mands

     % grep −c csh$ /etc/passwd
     27
     % grep −c nsh$ /etc/passwd
     128
     % grep −c −v sh$ /etc/passwd
     430
     %

Since these commands are very similar we can use [4mforeach[24m  to
do this more easily.

     % foreach i (´sh$´ ´csh$´ ´−v sh$´)
     ? grep −c $i /etc/passwd
     ? end
     27
     128
     430
     %

Note  here  that  the shell prompts for input with ‘? ’ when
reading the body of the loop.

     Very useful with  loops  are  variables  which  contain
lists of filenames or other words.  You can, for example, do

     % set a=(`ls`)
     % echo $a
     csh.n csh.rm
     % ls
     csh.n
     csh.rm
     % echo $#a
     2
     %

The  [4mset[24m  command here gave the variable [4ma[24m a list of all the
filenames in the current directory as value.   We  can  then
iterate over these names to perform any chosen function.

     The  output  of a command within ‘`’ characters is con‐
verted by the shell to a list of words.  You can also  place
the  ‘`’  quoted  string  within ‘"’ characters to take each

(non‐empty) line as a component of the variable;  preventing
the lines from being split into words at blanks and tabs.  A
modifier ‘:x’ exists which can be used later to expand  each
component of the variable into another variable splitting it
into separate words at embedded blanks and tabs.

[1m4.2.  Braces { ... } in argument expansion[0m

     Another form of filename expansion, alluded  to  before
involves the characters ‘{’ and ‘}’.  These characters spec‐
ify that the contained strings, separated by ‘,’ are  to  be
consecutively substituted into the containing characters and
the results expanded left to right.  Thus

     A{str1,str2,...strn}B

expands to

     Astr1B Astr2B ... AstrnB

This expansion occurs before the other filename  expansions,
and  may  be applied recursively (i.e. nested).  The results
of each expanded string are sorted separately, left to right
order  being preserved.  The resulting filenames are not re‐
quired to exist if no other expansion mechanisms  are  used.
This means that this mechanism can be used to generate argu‐
ments which are not filenames, but which have common parts.

     A typical use of this would be

     mkdir ~/{hdrs,retrofit,csh}

to make subdirectories ‘hdrs’, ‘retrofit’ and ‘csh’ in  your
home directory.  This mechanism is most useful when the com‐
mon prefix is longer than in this example, i.e.

     chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}


[1m4.3.  Command substitution[0m

     A command enclosed in ‘`’ characters is replaced,  just
before  filenames are expanded, by the output from that com‐
mand.  Thus it is possible to do

     set pwd=`pwd`

to save the current directory in the variable [4mpwd[24m or to do

     ex `grep −l TRACE *.c`

to run the editor [4mex[24m  supplying  as  arguments  those  files
whose  names  end  in  ‘.c’ which have the string ‘TRACE’ in

[1m4.4.  Other details not covered here[0m

     In particular circumstances it may be necessary to know
the  exact  nature and order of different substitutions per‐
formed by the shell.  The exact meaning of certain  combina‐
tions  of  quotations is also occasionally important.  These
are detailed fully in its manual section.

     The shell has a number of  command  line  option  flags
mostly  of use in writing UNIX programs, and debugging shell
scripts.  See the csh(1) manual section for a list of  these
options.

               see also [4mdirs.[24m  The current directory ‘.’  is
               usually  the  first  [4mcomponent[24m  of the search
               path contained in  the  variable  [4mpath[24m,  thus
               commands  which  are  in  ‘.’ are found first
               (2.2).  The character ‘.’  is  also  used  in
               separating  [4mcomponents[24m  of  filenames  (1.6).
               The character ‘.’ at the beginning of a  [4mcom‐[0m
               [4mponent[24m of a [4mpathname[24m is treated specially and

alias          An [4malias[24m specifies  a  shorter  or  different
               name  for a UNIX command, or a transformation
               on a command to be performed  in  the  shell.
               The  shell  has  a command [4malias[24m which estab‐
               lishes [4maliases[24m and can  print  their  current
               values.   The  command [4munalias[24m is used to re‐
               move [4maliases[24m (2.4).

argument       Commands in UNIX receive a list  of  [4margument[0m
               words.  Thus the command

                    echo a b c

               consists of the [4mcommand[24m [4mname[24m ‘echo’ and three
               [4margument[24m words ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’.  The set  of
               [4marguments[24m  after  the [4mcommand[24m [4mname[24m is said to
               be the [4margument[24m [4mlist[24m of the command (1.1).

argv           The list of arguments to a command written in
               the  shell  language (a shell script or shell
               procedure) is stored  in  a  variable  called
               [4margv[24m  within  the  shell.  This name is taken
               from the conventional name in the C  program‐
               ming language (3.4).

background     Commands  started without waiting for them to
               complete  are  called   [4mbackground[24m   commands
               (2.6).

base           A  filename  is  sometimes thought of as con‐
               sisting of a [4mbase[24m part, before any ‘.’  char‐
               acter,  and an [4mextension[24m − the part after the
               ‘.’.  See [4mfilename[24m and  [4mextension[24m  (1.6)  and
               basename (1).

bg             The [4mbg[24m command causes a [4msuspended[24m job to con‐
               tinue execution in the [4mbackground[24m (2.6).

bin            A directory containing binaries  of  programs
               and shell scripts to be executed is typically
               called a [4mbin[24m directory.  The standard  system
               [4mbin[24m  directories  are  ‘/bin’  containing the
               most heavily  used  commands  and  ‘/usr/bin’
               which  contains  most  other  user  programs.
               Programs developed at  UC  Berkeley  live  in
               ‘/usr/ucb’,  while  locally  written programs
               live in ‘/usr/local’.  Games are kept in  the
               directory  ‘/usr/games’.  You can place bina‐
               ries in any directory.  If you wish  to  exe‐
               cute  them often, the name of the directories
               should be a [4mcomponent[24m of the variable [4mpath[24m.

break          [4mBreak[24m is a builtin command used to exit  from
               loops  within  the  control  structure of the
               shell (3.7).

breaksw        The [4mbreaksw[24m builtin command is used  to  exit
               from a [4mswitch[24m control structure, like a [4mbreak[0m
               exits from loops (3.7).

builtin        A command executed directly by the  shell  is
               called  a  [4mbuiltin[24m command.  Most commands in
               UNIX are not built into the shell, but rather
               exist  as  files  in  [4mbin[24m directories.  These
               commands are accessible because the  directo‐
               ries  in  which  they reside are named in the
               [4mpath[24m variable.

case           A [4mcase[24m command is used as a label in a [4mswitch[0m
               statement  in  the shell’s control structure,
               similar to that of the language  C.   Details
               are  given  in  the  shell documentation ‘csh
               (1)’ (3.7).

cat            The [4mcat[24m program catenates a list of specified
               files  on the [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m.  It is usually
               used to look at the contents of a single file
               on the terminal, to ‘cat a file’ (1.8, 2.3).

cd             The  [4mcd[24m command is used to change the [4mworking[0m
               [4mdirectory[24m.  With  no  arguments,  [4mcd[24m  changes
               your [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m to be your [4mhome[24m direc‐
               tory (2.4, 2.7).

chdir          The [4mchdir[24m command is a synonym for [4mcd[24m.  [4mCd[24m is
               usually used because it is easier to type.

chsh           The  [4mchsh[24m command is used to change the shell
               which you use on UNIX.  By default, you use a
               different  version of the shell which resides
               in ‘/bin/sh’.  You can change your  shell  to
               ‘/bin/csh’ by doing

                    chsh your‐login‐name /bin/csh

               Thus I would do

                    chsh bill /bin/csh

               It  is  only  necessary to do this once.  The
               next time you log in to UNIX after doing this
               command,  you  will  be using [4mcsh[24m rather than
               the shell in ‘/bin/sh’ (1.9).

cmp            [4mCmp[24m is a program which compares files.  It is
               usually  used  on  binary files, or to see if

               two files are identical (3.6).  For comparing
               text  files  the  program  [4mdiff[24m, described in
               ‘diff (1)’ is used.

command        A function performed by the system, either by
               the shell (a builtin [4mcommand[24m) or by a program
               residing in a file in a directory within  the
               UNIX system, is called a [4mcommand[24m (1.1).

command name
               When  a  command  is issued, it consists of a
               [4mcommand[24m [4mname[24m, which is the first word of  the
               command,  followed by arguments.  The conven‐
               tion on UNIX is that the first word of a com‐
               mand  names  the  function  to  be  performed
               (1.1).

command substitution
               The replacement of a command enclosed in  ‘`’
               characters by the text output by that command
               is called [4mcommand[24m [4msubstitution[24m (4.3).

component      A part of a [4mpathname[24m between  ‘/’  characters
               is  called  a  [4mcomponent[24m of that [4mpathname[24m.  A
               variable which has multiple strings as  value
               is  said  to  have  several  [4mcomponent[24ms; each
               string is a [4mcomponent[24m of the variable.

continue       A builtin command which causes  execution  of
               the  enclosing [4mforeach[24m or [4mwhile[24m loop to cycle
               prematurely.  Similar to the [4mcontinue[24m command
               in the programming language C (3.6).

control‐       Certain  special  characters,  called [4mcontrol[0m
               characters, are produced by holding down  the
               CONTROL  key  on your terminal and simultane‐
               ously pressing another character,  much  like
               the  SHIFT  key is used to produce upper case
               characters. Thus  [4mcontrol‐[24mc  is  produced  by
               holding  down  the CONTROL key while pressing
               the ‘c’ key.  Usually UNIX prints a caret (^)
               followed by the corresponding letter when you
               type a [4mcontrol[24m character (e.g. ‘^C’ for  [4mcon‐[0m
               [4mtrol‐[24mc (1.8).

core dump      When  a  program  terminates  abnormally, the
               system places an image of its  current  state
               in  a  file named ‘core’.  This [4mcore[24m [4mdump[24m can
               be examined with  the  system  debugger  ‘adb
               (1)’  or ‘sdb (1)’ in order to determine what
               went wrong with the program  (1.8).   If  the
               shell produces a message of the form











USD:4‐54                      An Introduction to the C shell


                    Illegal instruction (core dumped)

               (where  ‘Illegal  instruction’ is only one of
               several possible messages), you should report
               this to the author of the program or a system
               administrator, saving the ‘core’ file.

cp             The [4mcp[24m (copy) program is  used  to  copy  the
               contents  of  one file into another file.  It
               is one of the most commonly  used  UNIX  com‐
               mands (1.6).

csh            The name of the shell program that this docu‐
               ment describes.

.cshrc         The file [4m.cshrc[24m in  your  [4mhome[24m  directory  is
               read  by  each  shell as it begins execution.
               It is usually used to change the  setting  of
               the variable [4mpath[24m and to set [4malias[24m parameters
               which are to take effect globally (2.1).

cwd            The [4mcwd[24m variable in the shell holds the [4mabso‐[0m
               [4mlute[24m  [4mpathname[24m  of the current [4mworking[24m [4mdirec‐[0m
               [4mtory[24m.  It is changed by  the  shell  whenever
               your  current  [4mworking[24m  [4mdirectory[24m changes and
               should not be changed otherwise (2.2).

date           The [4mdate[24m command prints the current date  and
               time (1.3).

debugging      [4mDebugging[24m  is  the process of correcting mis‐
               takes in programs  and  shell  scripts.   The
               shell has several options and variables which
               may be used to aid in shell [4mdebugging[24m (4.4).

default:       The  label  [4mdefault:[24m  is  used  within  shell
               [4mswitch[24m statements, as it is in the C language
               to label the code to be executed if  none  of
               the [4mcase[24m labels matches the value switched on
               (3.7).

DELETE         The DELETE or RUBOUT key on the terminal nor‐
               mally  causes  an interrupt to be sent to the
               current job.  Many users change the interrupt
               character to be ^C.

detached       A command that continues running in the [4mback‐[0m
               [4mground[24m after you logout is  said  to  be  [4mde‐[0m
               [4mtached[24m.

diagnostic     An error message produced by a program is of‐
               ten referred to as a [4mdiagnostic[24m.  Most  error
               messages are not written to the [4mstandard[24m [4mout‐[0m
               [4mput[24m, since that is often directed  away  from









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐55


               the terminal (1.3, 1.5).  Error messsages are
               instead  written  to  the  [4mdiagnostic[24m  [4moutput[0m
               which may be directed away from the terminal,
               but usually is not.   Thus  [4mdiagnostics[24m  will
               usually appear on the terminal (2.5).

directory      A  structure  which  contains  files.  At any
               time you  are  in  one  particular  [4mdirectory[0m
               whose  names  can  be  printed by the command
               [4mpwd[24m.  The [4mchdir[24m command will  change  you  to
               another [4mdirectory[24m, and make the files in that
               [4mdirectory[24m visible. The [4mdirectory[24m in which you
               are  when you first login is your [4mhome[24m direc‐
               tory (1.1, 2.7).

directory stack
               The shell saves the names of previous [4mworking[0m
               [4mdirectories[24m  in  the [4mdirectory[24m [4mstack[24m when you
               change your current [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m via the
               [4mpushd[24m  command.   The  [4mdirectory[24m [4mstack[24m can be
               printed by using the [4mdirs[24m command, which  in‐
               cludes  your current [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m as the
               first directory name on the left (2.7).

dirs           The [4mdirs[24m command prints the shell’s [4mdirectory[0m
               [4mstack[24m (2.7).

du             The [4mdu[24m command is a program (described in ‘du
               (1)’) which prints the number of disk  blocks
               is  all  directories below and including your
               current [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m (2.6).

echo           The [4mecho[24m command prints its  arguments  (1.6,
               3.6).

else           The  [4melse[24m  command  is  part of the ‘if‐then‐
               else‐endif’ control command construct (3.6).

endif          If an [4mif[24m statement is  ended  with  the  word
               [4mthen[24m, all lines following the [4mif[24m up to a line
               starting with the word [4mendif[24m or [4melse[24m are exe‐
               cuted  if  the  condition between parentheses
               after the [4mif[24m is true (3.6).

EOF            An [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile[24m is generated by  the  terminal
               by  a control‐d, and whenever a command reads
               to the end of a file which it has been  given
               as  input.   Commands  receiving input from a
               [4mpipe[24m receive an [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile[24m when the  command
               sending  them input completes.  Most commands
               terminate when they receive  an  [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile[24m.
               The shell has an option to ignore [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile[0m
               from a terminal input which may help you keep
               from  logging  out accidentally by typing too

               many control‐d’s (1.1, 1.8, 3.8).

escape         A character ‘\’ used to prevent  the  special
               meaning  of a metacharacter is said to [4mescape[0m
               the character from its special meaning.  Thus

                    echo \*

               will echo the character ‘*’ while just

                    echo *

               will echo the names of the file in  the  cur‐
               rent  directory.   In this example, \ [4mescape[24ms
               ‘*’ (1.7).   There  is  also  a  non‐printing
               character called [4mescape[24m, usually labelled ESC
               or ALTMODE on terminal keyboards.  Some older
               UNIX  systems  use this character to indicate
               that output is to be [4msuspended[24m.  Most systems
               use control‐s to stop the output and control‐
               q to start it.

/etc/passwd    This file contains information about the  ac‐
               counts  currently on the system.  It consists
               of a line for each account with fields  sepa‐
               rated  by ‘:’ characters (1.8).  You can look
               at this file by saying

                    cat /etc/passwd

               The commands [4mfinger[24m and [4mgrep[24m are  often  used
               to  search for information in this file.  See
               ‘finger (1)’, ‘passwd(5)’, and ‘grep (1)’ for
               more details.

exit           The [4mexit[24m command is used to force termination
               of a shell script,  and  is  built  into  the
               shell (3.9).

exit status    A  command  which discovers a problem may re‐
               flect this back to the  command  (such  as  a
               shell)  which invoked (executed) it.  It does
               this by returning a non‐zero  number  as  its
               [4mexit[24m  [4mstatus[24m,  a status of zero being consid‐
               ered ‘normal termination’.  The [4mexit[24m  command
               can  be  used to force a shell command script
               to give a non‐zero [4mexit[24m [4mstatus[24m (3.6).

expansion      The replacement of strings in the shell input
               which contain metacharacters by other strings
               is referred to as the process  of  [4mexpansion[24m.
               Thus  the  replacement  of  the word ‘*’ by a
               sorted list of files in the current directory
               is  a  ‘filename  expansion’.   Similarly the









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐57


               replacement of the  characters  ‘!!’  by  the
               text of the last command is a ‘history expan‐
               sion’.  [4mExpansions[24m are also  referred  to  as
               [4msubstitutions[24m (1.6, 3.4, 4.2).

expressions    [4mExpressions[24m  are used in the shell to control
               the conditional structures used in the  writ‐
               ing  of shell scripts and in calculating val‐
               ues for these scripts.  The operators  avail‐
               able  in  shell  [4mexpressions[24m are those of the
               language C (3.5).

extension      Filenames often consist of a [4mbase[24m name and an
               [4mextension[24m separated by the character ‘.’.  By
               convention, groups  of  related  files  often
               share  the  same [4mroot[24m name.  Thus if ‘prog.c’
               were a C program, then the  object  file  for
               this  program  would  be  stored in ‘prog.o’.
               Similarly a  paper  written  with  the  ‘−me’
               nroff  macro  package might be stored in ‘pa‐
               per.me’ while a formatted version of this pa‐
               per  might  be kept in ‘paper.out’ and a list
               of spelling errors in ‘paper.errs’ (1.6).

fg             The [4mjob[24m [4mcontrol[24m command [4mfg[24m is used to  run  a
               [4mbackground[24m or [4msuspended[24m job in the [4mforeground[0m
               (1.8, 2.6).

filename       Each file in UNIX has a name consisting of up
               to  14 characters and not including the char‐
               acter ‘/’ which is used in [4mpathname[24m building.
               Most  [4mfilenames[24m do not begin with the charac‐
               ter ‘.’, and contain only letters and  digits
               with  perhaps  a ‘.’ separating the [4mbase[24m por‐
               tion of the [4mfilename[24m from an [4mextension[24m (1.6).

filename expansion
               [4mFilename[24m [4mexpansion[24m  uses  the  metacharacters
               ‘*’,  ‘?’ and ‘[’ and ‘]’ to provide a conve‐
               nient  mechanism  for  naming  files.   Using
               [4mfilename[24m [4mexpansion[24m it is easy to name all the
               files in the current directory, or all  files
               which have a common [4mroot[24m name. Other [4mfilename[0m
               [4mexpansion[24m mechanisms  use  the  metacharacter
               ‘~’  and allow files in other users’ directo‐
               ries to be named easily (1.6, 4.2).

flag           Many UNIX commands accept arguments which are
               not the names of files or other users but are
               used to modify the action  of  the  commands.
               These are referred to as [4mflag[24m options, and by
               convention consist of  one  or  more  letters
               preceded  by  the  character ‘−’ (1.2).  Thus
               the [4mls[24m (list files)  command  has  an  option









USD:4‐58                      An Introduction to the C shell


               ‘−s’  to  list  the  sizes of files.  This is
               specified

                    ls −s


foreach        The [4mforeach[24m command is used in shell  scripts
               and  at the terminal to specify repetition of
               a sequence of commands while the value  of  a
               certain shell variable ranges through a spec‐
               ified list (3.6, 4.1).

foreground     When commands are executing in the normal way
               such  that  the  shell is waiting for them to
               finish before prompting for  another  command
               they  are  said to be [4mforeground[24m [4mjobs[24m or [4mrun‐[0m
               [4mning[24m [4min[24m [4mthe[24m [4mforeground[24m.  This is  as  opposed
               to   [4mbackground[24m.    [4mForeground[24m  jobs  can  be
               stopped by signals from the  terminal  caused
               by typing different control characters at the
               keyboard (1.8, 2.6).

goto           The shell has a command [4mgoto[24m  used  in  shell
               scripts  to transfer control to a given label
               (3.7).

grep           The [4mgrep[24m command searches through a  list  of
               argument files for a specified string.  Thus

                    grep bill /etc/passwd

               will  print each line in the file [4m/etc/passwd[0m
               which contains the string ‘bill’.   Actually,
               [4mgrep[24m  scans  for  [4mregular[24m  [4mexpressions[24m in the
               sense of the editors ‘ed (1)’ and  ‘ex  (1)’.
               [4mGrep[24m  stands  for  ‘globally find [4mregular[24m [4mex‐[0m
               [4mpression[24m and print’ (2.4).

head           The [4mhead[24m command prints the first  few  lines
               of one or more files.  If you have a bunch of
               files containing text which you are wondering
               about it is sometimes useful to run [4mhead[24m with
               these files as arguments.  This will  usually
               show  enough of what is in these files to let
               you decide which you are interested in (1.5).
               [4mHead[24m is also used to describe the part  of  a
               [4mpathname[24m  before  and  including the last ‘/’
               character.  The [4mtail[24m of  a  [4mpathname[24m  is  the
               part  after  the last ‘/’.  The ‘:h’ and ‘:t’
               modifiers allow the [4mhead[24m or [4mtail[24m of  a  [4mpath‐[0m
               [4mname[24m  stored  in  a shell variable to be used
               (3.6).











An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐59


history        The [4mhistory[24m mechanism  of  the  shell  allows
               previous  commands  to  be repeated, possibly
               after modification to correct typing mistakes
               or to change the meaning of the command.  The
               shell has a [4mhistory[24m [4mlist[24m where these commands
               are  kept,  and a [4mhistory[24m variable which con‐
               trols how large this list is (2.3).

home directory
               Each user has  a  [4mhome[24m  [4mdirectory[24m,  which  is
               given  in  your  entry  in the password file,
               [4m/etc/passwd[24m.  This is the directory which you
               are  placed  in when you first login.  The [4mcd[0m
               or [4mchdir[24m command with no arguments takes  you
               back   to   this  directory,  whose  name  is
               recorded in the shell variable [4mhome[24m.  You can
               also  access  the  [4mhome[24m  [4mdirectories[24m of other
               users in forming filenames using  a  [4mfilename[0m
               [4mexpansion[24m  notation  and  the  character  ‘~’
               (1.6).

if             A conditional command within the  shell,  the
               [4mif[24m  command  is used in shell command scripts
               to make decisions about what course of action
               to take next (3.6).

ignoreeof      Normally, your shell will exit, printing ‘lo‐
               gout’ if you type a control‐d at a prompt  of
               ‘%  ’.   This  is the way you usually log off
               the system.  You can [4mset[24m the [4mignoreeof[24m  vari‐
               able if you wish in your [4m.login[24m file and then
               use the command [4mlogout[24m to  logout.   This  is
               useful if you sometimes accidentally type too
               many control‐d characters,  logging  yourself
               off (2.2).

input          Many  commands  on UNIX take information from
               the terminal or from files  which  they  then
               act  on.   This  information is called [4minput[24m.
               Commands normally read for [4minput[24m  from  their
               [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m which is, by default, the ter‐
               minal.  This [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m can be redirected
               from  a  file using a shell metanotation with
               the character ‘<’.  Many commands  will  also
               read from a file specified as argument.  Com‐
               mands placed in [4mpipelines[24m will read from  the
               output  of  the previous command in the [4mpipe‐[0m
               [4mline[24m.  The leftmost  command  in  a  [4mpipeline[0m
               reads  from the terminal if you neither redi‐
               rect its [4minput[24m nor give it a filename to  use
               as  [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m.  Special mechanisms exist
               for supplying  input  to  commands  in  shell
               scripts (1.5, 3.8).

interrupt      An [4minterrupt[24m is a signal to a program that is
               generated by typing ^C. (On older versions of
               UNIX  the  RUBOUT or DELETE key were used for
               this purpose.)  It causes  most  programs  to
               stop  execution.   Certain  programs, such as
               the shell and the editors, handle  an  [4minter‐[0m
               [4mrupt[24m  in  special  ways,  usually by stopping
               what they are doing and prompting for another
               command.   While  the  shell is executing an‐
               other command and waiting for it  to  finish,
               the shell does not listen to [4minterrupts.[24m  The
               shell often wakes up when you  hit  [4minterrupt[0m
               because  many  commands die when they receive
               an [4minterrupt[24m (1.8, 3.9).

job            One or more commands typed on the same  input
               line  separated  by ‘|’ or ‘;’ characters are
               run together and are called  a  [4mjob[24m.   Simple
               commands run by themselves without any ‘|’ or
               ‘;’ characters are the simplest  [4mjobs.[24m   [4mJobs[0m
               are  classified as [4mforeground[24m, [4mbackground[24m, or
               [4msuspended[24m (2.6).

job control    The builtin functions that control the execu‐
               tion of jobs are called [4mjob[24m [4mcontrol[24m commands.
               These are [4mbg,[24m [4mfg,[24m [4mstop,[24m [4mkill[24m (2.6).

job number     When each job is started  it  is  assigned  a
               small  number  called  a  [4mjob[24m [4mnumber[24m which is
               printed next to the job in the output of  the
               [4mjobs[24m command.  This number, preceded by a ‘%’
               character, can be used as an argument to  [4mjob[0m
               [4mcontrol[24m  commands  to indicate a specific job
               (2.6).

jobs           The [4mjobs[24m command prints a table showing  jobs
               that  are either running in the [4mbackground[24m or
               are [4msuspended[24m (2.6).

kill           A command which sends a signal to a job caus‐
               ing it to terminate (2.6).

.login         The  file  [4m.login[24m  in  your [4mhome[24m directory is
               read by the shell each time you login to UNIX
               and  the  commands there are executed.  There
               are a number of commands which  are  usefully
               placed  here,  especially [4mset[24m commands to the
               shell itself (2.1).

login shell    The shell that is started  on  your  terminal
               when  you  login  is called your [4mlogin[24m [4mshell[24m.
               It is different from other shells  which  you
               may  run  (e.g.  on shell scripts) in that it
               reads the [4m.login[24m file before reading commands

               from  the  terminal  and it reads the [4m.logout[0m
               file after you logout (2.1).

logout         The [4mlogout[24m command causes a  login  shell  to
               exit.  Normally, a login shell will exit when
               you hit control‐d generating an  [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile,[0m
               but  if  you have set [4mignoreeof[24m in you [4m.login[0m
               file then this will not work and you must use
               [4mlogout[24m to log off the UNIX system (2.8).

.logout        When  you log off of UNIX the shell will exe‐
               cute commands from the file [4m.logout[24m  in  your
               [4mhome[24m directory after it prints ‘logout’.

lpr            The  command  [4mlpr[24m is the line printer daemon.
               The standard input of [4mlpr[24m spooled and printed
               on  the UNIX line printer.  You can also give
               [4mlpr[24m a list of filenames as  arguments  to  be
               printed.  It is most common to use [4mlpr[24m as the
               last component of a [4mpipeline[24m (2.3).

ls             The [4mls[24m (list files) command  is  one  of  the
               most  commonly  used  UNIX commands.  With no
               argument filenames it prints the names of the
               files  in  the  current  directory.  It has a
               number of useful [4mflag[24m arguments, and can also
               be  given  the  names of directories as argu‐
               ments, in which case it lists  the  names  of
               the files in these directories (1.2).

mail           The  [4mmail[24m program is used to send and receive
               messages from other UNIX  users  (1.1,  2.1),
               whether they are logged on or not.

make           The  [4mmake[24m  command is used to maintain one or
               more related files and to organize  functions
               to be performed on these files.  In many ways
               [4mmake[24m is easier to use, and more helpful  than
               shell command scripts (3.2).

makefile       The  file  containing  commands  for  [4mmake[24m is
               called [4mmakefile[24m or [4mMakefile[24m (3.2).

manual         The [4mmanual[24m often referred  to  is  the  ‘UNIX
               manual’.   It  contains  8  numbered sections
               with a description of each UNIX program (sec‐
               tion  1), system call (section 2), subroutine
               (section 3), device (section 4), special data
               structure (section 5), game (section 6), mis‐
               cellaneous item (section 7) and system admin‐
               istration  program  (section  8).   There are
               also supplementary documents  (tutorials  and
               reference  guides)  for  individual  programs
               which require explanation in more detail.  An

               online  version  of  the [4mmanual[24m is accessible
               through the [4mman[24m command.   Its  documentation
               can be obtained online via

                    man man

               If  you can’t decide what manual page to look
               in, try the [4mapropos[24m(1) command.  The  supple‐
               mentary  documents  are  in subdirectories of
               /usr/doc.

metacharacter
               Many characters which are neither letters nor
               digits  have  special  meaning  either to the
               shell  or  to  UNIX.   These  characters  are
               called [4mmetacharacters[24m.  If it is necessary to
               place these characters in arguments  to  com‐
               mands without them having their special mean‐
               ing then they must be [4mquoted[24m.  An example  of
               a [4mmetacharacter[24m is the character ‘>’ which is
               used to indicate placement of output  into  a
               file.  For the purposes of the [4mhistory[24m mecha‐
               nism, most unquoted [4mmetacharacters[24m form sepa‐
               rate  words  (1.4).   The  appendix  to  this
               user’s manual  lists  the  [4mmetacharacters[24m  in
               groups by their function.

mkdir          The [4mmkdir[24m command is used to create a new di‐
               rectory.

modifier       Substitutions  with  the  [4mhistory[24m  mechanism,
               keyed  by  the character ‘!’  or of variables
               using the metacharacter ‘$’, are  often  sub‐
               jected to modifications, indicated by placing
               the character ‘:’ after the substitution  and
               following this with the [4mmodifier[24m itself.  The
               [4mcommand[24m [4msubstitution[24m mechanism  can  also  be
               used  to  perform  modification  in a similar
               way, but this notation is less clear (3.6).

more           The program [4mmore[24m writes a file on your termi‐
               nal  allowing you to control how much text is
               displayed at a time.  [4mMore[24m can  move  through
               the  file  screenful  by  screenful,  line by
               line, search forward for a string,  or  start
               again  at  the  beginning of the file.  It is
               generally the easiest way of viewing  a  file
               (1.8).

noclobber      The  shell has a variable [4mnoclobber[24m which may
               be set in the file [4m.login[24m to prevent acciden‐
               tal  destruction  of  files by the ‘>’ output
               redirection metasyntax  of  the  shell  (2.2,
               2.5).









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐63


noglob         The  shell variable [4mnoglob[24m is set to suppress
               the [4mfilename[24m [4mexpansion[24m of arguments  contain‐
               ing the metacharacters ‘~’, ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’ and
               ‘]’ (3.6).

notify         The [4mnotify[24m command tells the shell to  report
               on  the  termination of a specific [4mbackground[0m
               [4mjob[24m at the exact time it occurs as opposed to
               waiting  until just before the next prompt to
               report the termination.  The [4mnotify[24m variable,
               if set, causes the shell to always report the
               termination of [4mbackground[24m jobs  exactly  when
               they occur (2.6).

onintr         The  [4monintr[24m  command  is built into the shell
               and is used to control the action of a  shell
               command  script  when  an [4minterrupt[24m signal is
               received (3.9).

output         Many commands in UNIX result in some lines of
               text  which  are  called  their [4moutput.[24m  This
               [4moutput[24m is usually placed on what is known  as
               the  [4mstandard[24m  [4moutput[24m  which is normally con‐
               nected to the user’s terminal.  The shell has
               a  syntax  using  the  metacharacter  ‘>’ for
               redirecting the [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m of a  command
               to  a  file  (1.3).  Using the [4mpipe[24m mechanism
               and the metacharacter ‘|’ it is also possible
               for the [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m of one command to be‐
               come the [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m  of  another  command
               (1.5).   Certain  commands  such  as the line
               printer daemon [4mp[24m do not place  their  results
               on  the  [4mstandard[24m  [4moutput[24m  but rather in more
               useful places such as  on  the  line  printer
               (2.3).   Similarly  the  [4mwrite[24m command places
               its output on another user’s terminal  rather
               than  its  [4mstandard[24m  [4moutput[24m  (2.3).  Commands
               also have  a  [4mdiagnostic[24m  [4moutput[24m  where  they
               write  their  error messages.  Normally these
               go to the terminal even if the [4mstandard[24m  [4mout‐[0m
               [4mput[24m  has  been sent to a file or another com‐
               mand, but it is possible to direct error  di‐
               agnostics  along with [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m using a
               special metanotation (2.5).

path           The shell has a variable [4mpath[24m which gives the
               names of the directories in which it searches
               for the commands which it is given.   It  al‐
               ways checks first to see if the command it is
               given is built into the  shell.   If  it  is,
               then it need not search for the command as it
               can do it internally.  If the command is  not
               builtin,  then  the shell searches for a file
               with  the  name  given   in   each   of   the









USD:4‐64                      An Introduction to the C shell


               directories  in  the  [4mpath[24m  variable, left to
               right.  Since the normal  definition  of  the
               [4mpath[24m variable is

                    path (. /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin)

               the  shell  normally looks in the current di‐
               rectory, and then in the standard system  di‐
               rectories  ‘/usr/ucb’,  ‘/bin’ and ‘/usr/bin’
               for the named command (2.2).  If the  command
               cannot be found the shell will print an error
               diagnostic.  Scripts of shell  commands  will
               be  executed using another shell to interpret
               them if they have ‘execute’  permission  set.
               This  is  normally  true because a command of
               the form

                    chmod 755 script

               was executed to turn this execute  permission
               on  (3.3).   If you add new commands to a di‐
               rectory in the [4mpath[24m,  you  should  issue  the
               command [4mrehash[24m (2.2).

pathname       A list of names, separated by ‘/’ characters,
               forms a [4mpathname.[24m   Each  [4mcomponent,[24m  between
               successive  ‘/’ characters, names a directory
               in which the  next  [4mcomponent[24m  file  resides.
               [4mPathnames[24m  which begin with the character ‘/’
               are interpreted relative to the  [4mroot[24m  direc‐
               tory in the file system.  Other [4mpathnames[24m are
               interpreted relative to the current directory
               as  reported by [4mpwd.[24m  The last component of a
               [4mpathname[24m may name a  directory,  but  usually
               names a file.

pipeline       A  group  of commands which are connected to‐
               gether, the [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m of each connected
               to  the [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m of the next, is called
               a [4mpipeline.[24m  The [4mpipe[24m mechanism used to  con‐
               nect these commands is indicated by the shell
               metacharacter ‘|’ (1.5, 2.3).

popd           The [4mpopd[24m command changes the shell’s  [4mworking[0m
               [4mdirectory[24m  to the directory you most recently
               left using the [4mpushd[24m command.  It returns  to
               the  directory  without  having  to  type its

               [4mworking[24m [4mdirectory[24m before doing so (2.7).

port           The  part  of a computer system to which each
               terminal is connected is called a [4mport[24m.  Usu‐
               ally  the system has a fixed number of [4mports[24m,
               some of  which  are  connected  to  telephone

               lines  for  dial‐up access, and some of which
               are permanently wired  directly  to  specific
               terminals.

pr             The [4mpr[24m command is used to prepare listings of
               the contents of files with headers giving the
               name  of  the  file  and the date and time at
               which the file was last modified (2.3).

printenv       The [4mprintenv[24m command is  used  to  print  the
               current  setting of variables in the environ‐
               ment (2.8).

process        An instance of a running program is called  a
               [4mprocess[24m  (2.6).   UNIX assigns each [4mprocess[24m a
               unique number when it is started − called the
               [4mprocess[24m  [4mnumber[24m.  [4mProcess[24m [4mnumbers[24m can be used
               to stop individual [4mprocesses[24m using  the  [4mkill[0m
               or  [4mstop[24m commands when the [4mprocesses[24m are part
               of a detached [4mbackground[24m job.

program        Usually synonymous  with  [4mcommand[24m;  a  binary
               file or shell command script which performs a
               useful function is often called a [4mprogram[24m.

prompt         Many programs will print a [4mprompt[24m on the ter‐
               minal  when they expect input.  Thus the edi‐
               tor ‘ex (1)’ will print a ‘:’ when it expects
               input.  The shell [4mprompts[24m for input with ‘% ’
               and occasionally with ‘? ’ when reading  com‐
               mands from the terminal (1.1).  The shell has
               a variable [4mprompt[24m which may be set to a  dif‐
               ferent  value  to  change  the  shell’s  main
               [4mprompt[24m.  This is mostly used  when  debugging
               the shell (2.8).

pushd          The  [4mpushd[24m  command, which means ‘push direc‐
               tory’, changes the shell’s [4mworking[24m  [4mdirectory[0m
               and also remembers the current [4mworking[24m [4mdirec‐[0m
               [4mtory[24m before the change is made, allowing  you
               to  return to the same directory via the [4mpopd[0m
               command  later  without  retyping  its   name
               (2.7).

ps             The  [4mps[24m command is used to show the processes
               you are currently running.  Each  process  is
               shown  with its unique process number, an in‐
               dication of the terminal name it is  attached
               to, an indication of the state of the process
               (whether it  is  running,  stopped,  awaiting
               some  event  (sleeping),  and  whether  it is
               swapped out), and the amount of CPU  time  it
               has  used  so far.  The command is identified
               by printing some of the words  used  when  it









USD:4‐66                      An Introduction to the C shell


               was  invoked  (2.6).  Shells, such as the [4mcsh[0m
               you use to run the [4mps[24m command, are  not  nor‐
               mally shown in the output.

pwd            The  [4mpwd[24m  command prints the full [4mpathname[24m of
               the  current  [4mworking[24m  [4mdirectory[24m.   The  [4mdirs[0m
               builtin  command  is  usually  a  better  and
               faster choice.

quit           The [4mquit[24m signal, generated by a control‐\, is
               used to terminate programs which are behaving
               unreasonably.  It normally  produces  a  core
               image file (1.8).

quotation      The  process by which metacharacters are pre‐
               vented their special meaning, usually by  us‐
               ing  the  character  ‘´ in pairs, or by using
               the character ‘\’, is referred to  as  [4mquota‐[0m
               [4mtion[24m (1.7).

redirection    The  routing  of input or output from or to a
               file is known as [4mredirection[24m of input or out‐
               put (1.3).

rehash         The [4mrehash[24m command tells the shell to rebuild
               its internal  table  of  which  commands  are
               found  in  which  directories  in  your [4mpath[24m.
               This is necessary when a new program  is  in‐
               stalled in one of these directories (2.8).

relative pathname
               A [4mpathname[24m which does not begin with a ‘/’ is
               called a [4mrelative[24m [4mpathname[24m since it is inter‐
               preted [4mrelative[24m to the current [4mworking[24m [4mdirec‐[0m
               [4mtory[24m.  The first [4mcomponent[24m of such a [4mpathname[0m
               refers to some file or directory in the [4mwork‐[0m
               [4ming[24m [4mdirectory[24m, and subsequent [4mcomponents[24m  be‐
               tween ‘/’ characters refer to directories be‐
               low the [4mworking[24m  [4mdirectory[24m.   [4mPathnames[24m  that
               are  not  [4mrelative[24m  are called [4mabsolute[24m [4mpath‐[0m
               [4mnames[24m (1.6).

repeat         The [4mrepeat[24m command iterates another command a
               specified number of times.

root           The  directory  that is at the top of the en‐
               tire directory structure is called  the  [4mroot[0m
               directory  since  it is the ‘root’ of the en‐
               tire tree structure of directories.  The name
               used  in  [4mpathnames[24m  to  indicate the [4mroot[24m is
               ‘/’.  [4mPathnames[24m starting with ‘/’ are said to
               be  [4mabsolute[24m since they start at the [4mroot[24m di‐
               rectory.  [4mRoot[24m is also used as the part of  a
               [4mpathname[24m  that  is  left  after  removing the

               [4mextension[24m.  See [4mfilename[24m for a further expla‐
               nation (1.6).

RUBOUT         The  RUBOUT  or  DELETE  key is often used to
               erase the previously  typed  character;  some
               users  prefer the BACKSPACE for this purpose.
               On older versions of UNIX this key served  as
               the INTR character.

scratch file   Files  whose  names  begin with a ‘#’ are re‐
               ferred to as [4mscratch[24m [4mfiles[24m,  since  they  are
               automatically  removed  by the system after a
               couple of days of non‐use, or more frequently
               if disk space becomes tight (1.3).

script         Sequences  of shell commands placed in a file
               are called shell command [4mscripts[24m.  It is  of‐
               ten  possible  to  perform simple tasks using
               these [4mscripts[24m without writing a program in  a
               language such as C, by using the shell to se‐
               lectively run other programs (3.3, 3.10).

set            The builtin [4mset[24m command is used to assign new
               values  to  shell  variables  and to show the
               values of the current variables.  Many  shell
               variables  have  special meaning to the shell
               itself.  Thus by using the  [4mset[24m  command  the
               behavior of the shell can be affected (2.1).

setenv         Variables  in  the  environment ‘environ (5)’
               can be changed by using  the  [4msetenv[24m  builtin
               command  (2.8).   The [4mprintenv[24m command can be
               used to print the value of the  variables  in
               the environment.

shell          A  [4mshell[24m  is  a command language interpreter.
               It is possible to  write  and  run  your  own
               [4mshell[24m,  as  [4mshells[24m  are no different than any
               other programs as far as the system  is  con‐
               cerned.   This  manual deals with the details
               of one particular [4mshell[24m, called [4mcsh.[0m

shell script   See [4mscript[24m (3.3, 3.10).

signal         A [4msignal[24m in UNIX is a short message  that  is
               sent  to a running program which causes some‐
               thing to happen to that process.  [4mSignals[24m are
               sent either by typing special [4mcontrol[24m charac‐
               ters on the keyboard or by using the [4mkill[24m  or
               [4mstop[24m commands (1.8, 2.6).

sort           The [4msort[24m program sorts a sequence of lines in
               ways that can be controlled by argument [4mflags[0m
               (1.5).

source         The  [4msource[24m  command causes the shell to read
               commands from a specified file.  It  is  most
               useful for reading files such as [4m.cshrc[24m after
               changing them (2.8).

special character
               See [4mmetacharacters[24m and the appendix  to  this
               manual.

standard       We  refer  often  to  the  [4mstandard[24m [4minput[24m and
               [4mstandard[24m [4moutput[24m of commands.  See  [4minput[24m  and
               [4moutput[24m (1.3, 3.8).

status         A  command  normally returns a [4mstatus[24m when it
               finishes.  By convention a [4mstatus[24m of zero in‐
               dicates that the command succeeded.  Commands
               may return non‐zero [4mstatus[24m to  indicate  that
               some  abnormal event has occurred.  The shell
               variable [4mstatus[24m is set to the [4mstatus[24m returned
               by  the  last  command.  It is most useful in
               shell commmand scripts (3.6).

stop           The [4mstop[24m command causes a [4mbackground[24m  job  to
               become [4msuspended[24m (2.6).

string         A  sequential  group  of characters taken to‐
               gether is called a [4mstring[24m.  [4mStrings[24m can  con‐
               tain any printable characters (2.2).

stty           The  [4mstty[24m  program changes certain parameters
               inside UNIX which determine how your terminal
               is  handled.   See  ‘stty (1)’ for a complete
               description (2.6).

substitution   The shell implements a  number  of  [4msubstitu‐[0m
               [4mtions[24m  where sequences indicated by metachar‐
               acters are replaced by other sequences.   No‐
               table  examples of this are history [4msubstitu‐[0m
               [4mtion[24m keyed by the metacharacter ‘!’ and vari‐
               able  [4msubstitution[24m indicated by ‘$’.  We also
               refer to [4msubstitutions[24m as [4mexpansions[24m (3.4).

suspended      A job becomes [4msuspended[24m after a  STOP  signal
               is  sent  to it, either by typing a [4mcontrol[24m‐z
               at the terminal (for [4mforeground[24m jobs)  or  by
               using the [4mstop[24m command (for [4mbackground[24m jobs).
               When [4msuspended[24m, a job temporarily stops  run‐
               ning  until  it is restarted by either the [4mfg[0m
               or [4mbg[24m command (2.6).

switch         The [4mswitch[24m command of the  shell  allows  the
               shell  to select one of a number of sequences
               of commands based on an argument string.   It
               is  similar  to  the  [4mswitch[24m statement in the









An Introduction to the C shell                      USD:4‐69


               language C (3.7).

termination    When a command which is being  executed  fin‐
               ishes we say it undergoes [4mtermination[24m or [4mter‐[0m
               [4mminates.[24m  Commands  normally  terminate  when
               they  read an [4mend[24m‐[4mof[24m‐[4mfile[24m from their [4mstandard[0m
               [4minput[24m.  It is also possible to terminate com‐
               mands  by  sending  them an [4minterrupt[24m or [4mquit[0m
               signal (1.8).  The  [4mkill[24m  program  terminates
               specified jobs (2.6).

then           The  [4mthen[24m command is part of the shell’s ‘if‐
               then‐else‐endif’ control  construct  used  in
               command scripts (3.6).

time           The  [4mtime[24m  command can be used to measure the
               amount of CPU and real  time  consumed  by  a
               specified  command  as  well as the amount of
               disk i/o, memory utilized, and number of page
               faults  and  swaps taken by the command (2.1,
               2.8).

tset           The [4mtset[24m program  is  used  to  set  standard
               erase  and  kill  characters  and to tell the
               system what kind of terminal you  are  using.
               It is often invoked in a [4m.login[24m file (2.1).

tty            The word [4mtty[24m is a historical abbreviation for
               ‘teletype’ which is frequently used  in  UNIX
               to  indicate the [4mport[24m to which a given termi‐
               nal is connected.  The [4mtty[24m command will print
               the  name  of  the  [4mtty[24m or [4mport[24m to which your
               terminal is presently connected.

unalias        The [4munalias[24m command removes aliases (2.8).

UNIX           UNIX is an  operating  system  on  which  [4mcsh[0m
               runs.   UNIX  provides facilities which allow
               [4mcsh[24m to invoke other programs such as  editors
               and  text  formatters  which  you may wish to
               use.

unset          The [4munset[24m command removes the definitions  of
               shell variables (2.2, 2.8).

variable expansion
               See [4mvariables[24m and [4mexpansion[24m (2.2, 3.4).

variables      [4mVariables[24m  in [4mcsh[24m hold one or more strings as
               value.  The most common use of  [4mvariables[24m  is
               in  controlling  the  behavior  of the shell.
               See [4mpath[24m, [4mnoclobber[24m, and [4mignoreeof[24m for  exam‐
               ples.   [4mVariables[24m  such as [4margv[24m are also used
               in  writing  shell  programs  (shell  command

               scripts) (2.2).

verbose        The  [4mverbose[24m  shell  variable  can  be set to
               cause commands to be echoed  after  they  are
               history  expanded.   This  is often useful in
               debugging shell scripts.  The  [4mverbose[24m  vari‐
               able  is  set  by the shell’s [4m−v[24m command line
               option (3.10).

wc             The [4mwc[24m program calculates the number of char‐
               acters,  words,  and lines in the files whose
               names are given as arguments (2.6).

while          The [4mwhile[24m builtin control construct  is  used

word           A sequence of characters which forms an argu‐
               ment to a command is  called  a  [4mword[24m.   Many
               characters which are neither letters, digits,
               ‘−’, ‘.’ nor ‘/’ form [4mwords[24m all by themselves
               even  if  they  are not surrounded by blanks.
               Any sequence of characters may be made into a
               [4mword[24m  by  surrounding  it with ‘´’ characters
               except for the characters ‘´’ and  ‘!’  which
               require   special   treatment   (1.1).   This
               process  of  placing  special  characters  in
               [4mwords[24m without their special meaning is called
               [4mquoting[24m.

working directory
               At any given time you are in  one  particular
               directory,  called  your  [4mworking[24m  [4mdirectory[24m.
               This directory’s name is printed by  the  [4mpwd[0m
               command  and  the  files listed by [4mls[24m are the
               ones in this directory.  You can change [4mwork‐[0m
               [4ming[24m [4mdirectories[24m using [4mchdir[24m.

write          The  [4mwrite[24m command is an obsolete way of com‐
               municating with other users who are logged in
               to  UNIX (you have to take turns typing).  If
               you are both  using  display  terminals,  use
               [4mtalk[24m(1), which is much more pleasant.
